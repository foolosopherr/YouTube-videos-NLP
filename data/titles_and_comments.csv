65,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"The fact that you just said , ""the first thing to know is programming"" shows the level or lack of your mathematical understanding behind the concepts of something which might seem to be as trivial as linear regression. However, most if not all credible data scientists know the complexity of math behind the aforementioned concept , ranging from intercept interpretation to exchanging penalties with constraints in regularized models which will branch out to more non linear models like svm's using KKT theorem.. Please stop misleading people like this...
Regards,
A novice Data Scientist."

96,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),My goal for this year is to find a data scientist internship....
97,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Do you think an undergraduate degree in data science is worth doing if its something that interests me? I don't reckon you're too familiar with many uk univerisites (my bad if i am mistaken) but i have an offer to study data science at warwick, and an offer to study computer science at manchester - the main reason i consider the data science degree is because i like the look of it a lot, but if i keep an interest in coding (though the degree has a lot of options for coding modules within it already), that I won't really be doing myself any wrong picking the data science undergrad over the computer science undergrad? My main concern is only that a cs grad may be viewed slightly more preferable in a range of places just by degree name, but i dont know if thats true or not"

105,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hi I'm doing Bachelor's in IT. I'm very much interested in Data Science. I've just started my data science journey. I've decided to study Statistics, Algebra, Data Visualization, MLA online through some courses. Will it be a good start?? And would I be able to get a job after graduation in Data science??"
106,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hey Ken -
I'm considering pulling the trigger on investing in 365 Data Science.  It seems comprehensive and very reasonably priced.  A lot of comm colleges I've looked at don't seem offer too many of these types of courses.  While most of them have Calc 1 - III, they seem to be lacking in other areas (like data structures and stats courses beyond elementary stats).  I realize they are only two year programs.  Any insight regarding which CCs might be offering a more Data Science specific majors at some point in the near future?  Would a comp sci program be of any use?
I have been getting a lot out of working through some of these Kaggle projects.  Honestly, just looking through the comments, code, and how previous projects were built are extremely helpful.  (Your Titantic project example is certainly among them).  
I apologize for bombarding you with these long-winded questions.  I do, however, greatly appreciate the insight you pump out via YouTube. 
 As difficult as this material can be, I do find your words and wisdom inspiring.  It's also nice to see occasional rays of light while sifting through all these reams of data, code, algorithms, and math.  It does spark ideas in my ""not-so-mathematically-inclined"" brain.
Thanks again"

140,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hello, I am struggling to choose a major. I have attained my associate of science transfer degree and need to choose a major. I think I am interested in an information science and data analysis program, but the requirements say you must already have a previous ""skill set"" with python, java, oracle, and linux, or similar to each of those. I am a first gen college student so I am extremely unfamiliar with everything basically. The counselors don't provide any helpful info about specific majors. So, can you tell me, am I supposed to study these on my own, and then apply? Do most people learn on their own, and then apply for majors involving them? I was always under the impression that most people take college courses/gain credits for these but apparently it's wrong? Isn't college for finding what you enjoy too? How would I ever know if I like data analyses and python if I've never taken an actual class on it? Sorry, I just really feel so lost right now."

197,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),You have some good points but the problem is that most projects require deep learning knowledge.

262,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Agreed, there is no replacement for real world projects.   When tutorials are designed, they will always come to a successful model with good results and will usually have the data nicely prepared for you.  That's exactly opposite of the real world.  You may work on a project for weeks and conclude there is no signal in the data at least in its current form, or you may work weeks on just preparing data or learning enough domain knowledge to understand the data.  That said tutorials and class learning are great to learn the workflow and structure of analysis. As you said you will be constantly going back and forth between direct coding and learning new methods to tackle new problems.  I would say if you have an idea of the domain you will be working in, you should focus your efforts on the models and concepts relevant to that domain.  There isn't a whole lot of similarity between analyzing mass scientific tabular data and computer vision."

265,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"A couple of years down the line I want to build ML algorithms that do simple yet effective stuff. My weak area is statistics and this is something I really need to improve on. Understanding the equations of the graph to begin with maybe? Although I know a lot of statistical packages do most of the stuff for you but I believe understanding the underlying algorithm or the derivation of the equations would be helpful further down the line as I progress. With plethora of resources, I simply don't know where to get started and where to stop. I understand the python codes that someone else may have written but I am yet to reach a stage where I can start building something from scratch and that is something I really need to push myself to achieve as quickly as I can. Any help to get me closer to this is much appreciated!"

I have obtained Master degree in Telecommunications and am working as a network engineer. I have realized that I miss programming so much since I was very good at it and math in high school. I had some programming on college (C, MATLAB, some very basic Python), but since then stopped programming because my job doesn't require it. I like data science, artificial intelligence and Python, so I enrolled in PhD program in IoT where I've got some subjects such are Neural networks and Artificial intelligence in telecommunications.
Please, do you have any advice on how to manage my time since I am doing a job with shifts, have to study and make projects for PhD and need to learn Python, statistics and similar topics in order to make career change and become data scientist? I would much appreciate if you give me concrete examples/materials what to study and pace for passing them.

470,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Nice video! I'm not familiar with your channel but saw the thumbnail/its length and clicked through - a few other ideas/resources to choose from that I think can be really helpful for beginners depending on how they like to learn:
---------------
1. Make a habit of partitioning off a small portion of your learning time to do some light reading on best practices - this is softer information and can often be more subjective than the harder skills, but it can be extremely helpful in adding context to why certain things are the way they are and potentially help save you some cleanup down the road (things like docstrings, virtual environments, project directory structure, etc). (Like everything else) this can be overwhelming and my advice would also be to choose one thing at a time and start trying to build it into your workflow - docstrings and virtual environments are both good examples of things that take a little getting used to but can feel very fluid after a short period of time and save a lot of headaches with package managers (+ if you're using vscode or PyCharm the autodocstrings are great and keep your time spent doing the things the machine can't, not playing with margins)
---------------
2. Listening to podcasts about the subject (IMO) is also extremely valuable and can be done on the go - even if as a beginner you don't understand much that they're talking about, hearing others talk about common problems before you get to them can help you understand what's happening more quickly whenever you do. Additionally, a huge part of this field is learning how to articulate the problem you're trying to solve for on google/stack, and listening to podcasts can help you learn how to articulate things better both verbally and in writing. I'm much less familiar with the R podcast landscape but for Python beginners, Talk Python To Me is great for slightly deeper dives into a specific problem domain and Python Bytes is good/fun weekly exposure to the evolving packaging landscape.
2.1 Quick addition to the above point, another thing it can really help with is understanding the extent to which most problems, particularly on the data processing/cleansing/wrangling front have already been solved for - I've often seen more novice programmers try to recreate the wheel at every turn and hearing more experienced people unpack how they approach problem solving can help save you from writing a script to do something that's part of a standard library.
---------------
3. Time spent finding the right resources is never time wasted - in addition to paid courses/etc, I'd encourage finding someone on Youtube/similar who does a good job of articulating things in a way that makes sense to you. Corey Schafer has a  fantastic Python channel covering everything from basics/best practices to end-to-end application development
---------------
4. Acknowledging that this would fall somewhere towards the latter half of the progression outlined in your video, I think it's super worth calling out that all the services we use personally have open APIs from which we can programmatically extract our data from and can be a great way to build out your mechanics in a fun/more personal way - it's also a natural and safer step towards web scraping since it's all the same communication protocol. Amongst many others, Spotify has a super user-friendly API and a well-supported helper library called Spotipy for anyone who might like this idea and be looking for a place to start Python beginnings to start learning how APIs work.
---------------
Again great video and I hope the data dump's welcomed:)"
471,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hi Ken Jee, it's my first time here in this channel. Thanks for sharing your data science journey and giving good advice.

480,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Good starting point. Let me share my experience. I have a master in statistics,  I can code in R, and I have good experience to conceptualize data products. However, I'm still far from a data scientist. There's more about data engineering (getting the data ready) and deployment (platforms, UIs, APIs, servers, containerized, DevOps) that need to be included in my skillset. Your journey shows almost half the way towards data science.

This is for everyone: keep learning new tricks and practicing with real examples."

492,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"i learned tableau basics .. dont know python can i get a job ,,though my futuristic plan is complete data science"
493,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"I think learning by doing is a wonderful, fun and efficient way to learn a range of skills.  HOWEVER, after 40+ years developing for large, medium and small commercial, non-profit, military/defense and other companies across communications, strategic data, media, AI, quantum-AI, full stack and other areas, I have also seen the dangers of that as a primary, let alone singular learning approach.   

People who learn exclusive via doing— especially working predominately on their own while eschewing theory and complementary skills prior to that approach, often have major applied theory and application context gaps in their knowledge that they appear generally unaware of.  Obviously, this depends whether you are learning predominately on your own, or if you have guide(s), mentor(s) and/or teacher(s) that help point out short-comings and gaps in your knowledge base and approaches. 

There are multiple factors underlying this problem.  First, it is very hard for most people to deeply self-introspect to see where they lie on broad based external knowledge continuums without significant sources of historical, theoretical and contextual reference.  This is why the first factor of where people are on the Dunning-Kruger curve skews left with people who have largely self-educated without a broader base of external references as noted above.  

The second factor is the fact that most of the time, most people simply do not know what they don’t know.  In other words, it takes a broad base of external theoretical, historical and contextual learning to develop metacognitive skills to help us intuit where we have gaps in our knowledge base, and to consistently discern correct from incorrect conclusions.  While working on our own is a great way to learn deep, practical skills, we see that it often comes along with blinders to broader alternative views and approaches.  In other words, you can easily be unwittingly blind to the fact that your toolbox is mostly bare, and that you don’t know how to optimally use even the tools you do have.  For example, we see people who have never heard of Donald E. Knuth, JADD or Charles Petzold that have instead learned simply by doing, who code using approaches that others have long since bypassed, resulting in programming that causes problems and often must be rewritten and projects that must be taken over by other groups— ideally prior to them causing real world problems in the end user community.  

So, while there is no substitute for hands on learning and many have succeeded in becoming gainfully employed as programmers without much classical computer programming training or academic education;  even hands-on learning approaches work better in the form of a balanced apprenticeship approach, where you work autonomously, but under the direction and oversight of someone much more knowledgeable and skilled than yourself.

The fact is that the number of software developers on the planet doubles every 5 years.  As such, by definition this means that half of software developers have less than 5 years experience.  The number goes down as you get to more specialized areas of knowledge that increasingly can have a broad based impact in unforeseen ways on the future of humanity.  For example, the number of AI programmers is doubling every 12-14 months and is still falling.  

This means that on average, AI programmers have a year or less programming skills in AI.  Increasingly, the percentage that have any significant general programming or computer science education is dropping, as the demand for AI programmers is far outstripping what our universities and training centers can provide.  As such, more people are self-educating, often by jumping in and doing prior to getting any significant training.  

Sadly, many of us who don’t get the academic knowledge and theory up front, never go back later to address that, since they get too busy and immerse in immediate needs.  So, the gaps and deficiencies upon entering the workforce often are carried throughout their carrier.  Often they become highly proficient programmers and such, in whatever language(s) they happen to need for the tasks at hand, but they often don’t learn to intuit when, for example they should turn to something like Node.js versus Python, or use Matlab vs Tensorflow, etc,

So, what is the negative result of people learning predominately hands-on rather than under the oversight of others who are significantly more knowledgeable and skilled, and preferably with a good foundation of theory and broad based learning to bolster their metacognitive, theory and analytical skills development?   The result is that suboptimal approaches, zero hour bugs, and higher rates of failed projects, as defined by the failure to meet one or more primary deliverables as defined by the final SOW.   

Further, as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world, we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths, flash crashes in major global markets, just in time delivery system failures and much more.  We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands-on approaches.

So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhD’s in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people from a financial standpoint, what are the alternatives?  First, online learning when done in conjunction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful high utility educational base.  Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in.

So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhD’s in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people, what are the alternatives.  First, online learning when done in conjuction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful way to learn.  Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in.  For example, say you spent a few hundred hours learning and taking on a few projects in Python and Swift.  You should also read several of the seminal computer programming theory and related books— at the very least in the areas you are focusing on, and preferably add to them over time once you have internalized their benefit.  Statistics repeatedly show that people who never learned core theory prior to beginning a career have a much lower chance of ever learning those areas.

Similarly, it can be a great boon to identify a local universities or a company that needs interns where you can work under and along side others with different skills. While the pay may be minimal or non-existent, EVERYONE (self-taught, university skilled and all other modalities of learning) should intern— just as is done in other mission critical and related fields like medicine.   And it is a LOT cheaper than the college alternative.  In medicine it is done on top of 6-9 years of additional post-university graduation education, while in computer programming, a rapidly increasing percentage never even get any post graduation training of any significant merit— let alone intern/apprenticeship training.   

Is professional programming any less deep or broad of an area of knowledge?   Not if you want to excel in terms of being at least well rounded and far more employable than average— and definitely not if you wish to excel in skills, compensation and job satisfaction.  So, don’t migrate primarily to hands-on without getting a good base of other approaches behind you, because statistically you probably will never go back to rectify the competency, knowledge and related gaps you create by doing so."

So far on my journey, I have acquired a Certificate in Data Science from UCI (very high-level stuff, didn't really go into great depths, mostly theory), but I always have these doubts that I am too old to get into tech or that I don't have enough real world experience to get into tech.

610,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hi, thanks for the video. I was really looking for this kind of answers. Although I already signed in the 365 data science course in Udemy before watching this.

Just I have a question that terrifies me. Do I need to be a math wizard? Just the word algorithm terrifies me.
I always struggle with numbers, even now I miss the most common and simple operations. 

I'm doing a statistics course in Khan Academy to catch up as fast as I can. But still freak out about it.

What can you suggest? Not to panic? Or focus myself inf hard core maths, statistics, algebra...???

Hope you can answer."
611,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Without real world experience you won't have any credibility.

613,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hey Ken, I don't know you, but the algorithm recommended this vid.  I think it is better if you start off with describing a bit about who you are otherwise I don't think the title itself can really grab people's attention because you haven't established validity.  Maybe just something to think about for future vids."
614,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"I have become very confused with the different advice various people give regarding data science. The coding languages like R and python seem to give the user a more technical and intricate level of work but these don't seem inviting to me when there are options like Matlab available which is significantly more user friendly especially for beginners. I graduated with an engineering degree last year, I have since tried to study machine learning with python after having no background in the language and it seemed more difficult to study and memorize all the different algorithms one has to go and create or the the different uses of packages like numpy. On the other hand I started a course on data science with MATLAB and the ease of graphing and using visual aids seemed to make Matlab a more desirable choice for me. That being said, I don't really hear of Matlab being a buzz-word in the data science community, why is this? Where would Matlab be more applicable than software languages like python or R?"
615,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Thanks very much - really helpful.  I think my goal right now is to figure out what my goal is ;-)

621,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),This is so helpful. I'm really new to Data Science field. I'm working as an intern data scientist. I don't really have much work at office which is really frustrating. I'm applying to many companies but I'm not able to get into any. Can someone tell me what am I don't wrong?
622,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Thanks for a really informative, helpful video."
623,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Hey Ken have you thought about creating an intensive comprehensive course in Data Science? Lots of courses just teach the concepts but not real-world varied applications with different dirty and challenging datasets?

626,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),I guess you would be The Data Lead ?
627,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),1:15
628,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. We’re not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 

2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, “almost no companies know what data science is”. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: it’s the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. That’s it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. I’m telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 

3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesn’t say data scientist doesn’t mean your not going to do data science work. I’m a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server,  Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDE’s get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. 

My job title is NOT data scientist. 

My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of “must know Python”, it’s a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist don’t know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldn’t tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print  “hello world” in Python. Yet they’re interviewing candidates for Python development. 😁

If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player. That means work on everything sent your way. And show off your skills. 

Good luck!"

666,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hi Ken,
I have a question for you: I'm studying social sciences at the moment with a specialization in quantitative data analysis. We're not just doing basic stuff, I already did courses on geodata analysis, network analysis (even did an analysis of Twitter communities with data that I scraped with the Twitter rest API), multilevel models, structural equation models and causal analysis. But we have no courses on machine learning (actually there would have been a course this semester, but it got dropped because of corona -.- I guess it's too difficult to run a Zoom stream for a guy working with machine learning, idk...). And we also didn't do much on efficient coding / speeding up the code. I'm mostly working with R.
What do you say would be a good next step to get deeper into data science with that pretty solid foundation of knowledge on statistics? Can you recommend courses, books or other sources for my situation? All the data science sources that I found were starting from zero which was a bit annoying for me.

Thanks!"

If I heard correctly, you said it took you five years to get to where you are today. Can you shed some more light on that? During the last five years were you working as a data scientist/analyst, or is this something that you pursue in your spare time? 

I am wondering because I am trying to transition into a career related to data science. Specifically, I would to work in a role related quantitative research in the finance industry. I have been studying ~20 hours/week the last six months, and on and off the previous six months. I have been using resources such as Datacamp and Quantopian to practice and learn.

This makes it hard for me to present myself to companies because immediately they see you’re about to be a graduate with an Msc. in data science, they expect the most from you which is fair but then to someone like me who had zero background in this course before starting, it is quite intimidating. It makes me wonder if there’s ever a company out there who will have the patience to allow me to grow in my knowledge whiles still contributing to the job requirements."

752,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Ken, thanks for all of the informative advice. Do you think your Masters in Commerce which lead you into a analyst role provided you any significant foundation for programming/data science? Also, is the switch from data analytics to data science difficult?"
753,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Such videos are made by people who want to earn money while trying to become a Data Scientist.
754,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),I'm having hard time learning data structures and algorithms in python... Any suggestions to accelerate learning process..
755,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hello Ken, I love your videos, thanks so much for it! Do you use SQL in your projects? In other videos usually the people recommend start by SQL due the amount of data, what do you think?"
756,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hello, Ken. Very nice video, as usual. I've started my Data Science journey a few weeks ago, and I agree with your comments. I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes. Cheers"
757,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),sick new intro
758,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hey Ken, 
Thanks for valuable info.


A quick Q&A can / should data science learn online as you know lots of video will be find here of 11 hrs to 15 hrs learning OR need to go through proper channel of learn like enroll in paid classes with renounced institute 


What's your opinion ?"
759,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),You rock Ken
760,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Great video as usual , Thanks Ken"
761,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"on my first day i studied for too long well about 5-7 hours, I just finished watching and i did burn out and didn't go back to work for 2 days, i felt exhausted."
762,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Im just starting with programing like from the very very beginning, I've already been using the nba.api but i want to know what else can i do with that to learn more. I want to be a statistician in my future. Any Tips? Thanks for your videos they are helping. Ive also purchased Mathletics and its very good!!!"
763,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"First of all a huge thanks to you for bringing this exclusive content for us!
If you could, can you review the curriculum of this Data Science MSc programme. ( https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/datascience/#tab=structure )
I have an offer for this programme and I'm from a computer science background with minimal stats knowledge."
764,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"I need to build a distributed recommendation system for an e commerce to improve the UX from reatilers and servieces in my country. Features would be: 
from consumers perspective:

-Recommendations of alike products
-most vieew products such as you search
-processing text from a written list of products and searching the data base for those prodcuts
-users personalize input to search for best fit ..question for this woudl be; what categoriy of product you would like to buy? (this could be on or varous catergories), Do you  want the lowest to the highest price or you dont care?, do you want the nearest to the fardest location? ansd so on 
from retail perspective:

- profille of users
- goal clint 
- setting of weekly and monthly  goals
- reocomendation of which products to buy from markets feedback
- recommendation of products to buy from two alike products (based on demand, profit/cost, and snetiment of consumers about the product)
- sentiment analysis from consumers to products of the retailer
- sentiment analysis from consumers to overall perfomrance of retailer
-data visualization
and son on....Anybody could help me on gettin started about recomemndation systems? :)"
765,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Awesome video Ken. I'm about 1 month in so far. I enrolled in data science 365. Definitely filled in the gaps of my learning.
766,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hi Ken, can you do a desktop set up video to maximise productivity? :)"
767,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Python with their libraries...
768,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Thank you for the informative content!!! Helped a lot
769,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),New goal for Ken: Use rule of thirds in videos.
770,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Sweet, right on time. I'm a Mech. Engineer just got my first job as an engineer, but I've lost total interest for it. Data science might be the career for me.  Thanks for the tips.
Good luck to everyone thinking of a career change or those studying! We got this!"
771,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Liking your new intro and B-roll!! Thank you so much for the advice.
772,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Dataquest does a good job of covering all that in one place aside from personal projects though they do have projects. It’s been worth the money.
773,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"I'm currently finishing up law school between now and July (when I have to submit my thesis). Between now and the end of August though I would like to get through the 365 intro to stats course, 365 Python programming course, as well as 365 Data Science course. I do have to be extremely careful of burnout as you pointed out. However, I am extremely motivated to make this transition into Data Science. There's a Data Science bootcamp here in Toronto that I'm keen to attend which I'd hope to start in October. I'd like to go into that Bootcamp with a solid base, as most of the attendees in the Data Science stream seem to have solid technical experience."
774,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Thank you for providing your insights its always good to have some guidance from the people already in the domain.
775,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hey Ken! Thank you for all your videos. I was wondering if this changes any for people pursuing sports analytics. I was also wondering how to start with projects for sports analytics. I am currently 16 years old and am trying to learn coding and statistics during this time through free edx and coursera, but I still don't seem to be able to do any projects, especially ones that are new and intuitive. I want to publish new work, but over summer if I am only good enough to do projects that maybe others have done, is that still worth publishing? Thank you for any advice."
776,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),What course did you mentioned in Machine Learning?
777,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Love your content buddy.. i wanted to know what are your thoughts on IBM data science course offered by Coursera because i have undertaken this course and many others have as well... i just wanted to know where will it take me
778,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Merci from France :)
779,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Ken, do you have any sport analysis resources that you can recommend?"
780,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Thanks Ken for a great video on the roadmap of learning data science! The intro animation graphics looks awesome!
Well said, accountability indeed helps to keep us motivated and pushing it to meet the goals we set. Being accountable for one another in this comment community is surely a great way to move forward in learning data science together. 😀"
781,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hey Ken, could you do a project from scratch that would involve feature selection, feature scaling, PCA, data normalization etc. I did see your series of Data Scientist job positions from scratch but would like to know how the above concepts are incorporated in the project. Thanks."
782,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Really insightful
783,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),thank you for this video! would you recommend coursera courses? im studying IBM's data science courses rn and i wonder if these certificates help me to get data science internship or make a project
784,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Love the new intro Ken !! 



Definitely agree with staring projects as soon as you can. I spent too much time learning about functions and things I could do but constantly forgot them because I was never doing projects and applying them. Alot of my time was spent learning things but I never knew when or how to apply them because I never did projects at first!"
785,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Firstly, thanks for sharing your knowledge !  I live n Brazil and I'm graduate in Computer Engineer, recently signed a premium plan on DataCamp and I'm enjoying it."
786,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"I discovered 365 Data Science by your recommendation at the start of this pandemic. Their videos are highly informative and involve very detailed projects that will help you understand key concepts, as well as open the door for you to start making your own types of projects through what you will have learned. So, I definitely recommend them as well."
787,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Goal is to learn the basis of ML in the next 6 months. I'm going to come back to this comment
788,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hello Ken, 
If you could you suggest the order in which a person should learn ML algorithms? 

I would be very gratefull to you. 
Thanks"
789,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Thank you sir, please make a video on deep learning , its really difficult to learn that"
790,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Very helpful... thankyou for dedicating your precious time to guide beginners like me.. :)
791,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"Hey Ken, just wanted to show some support to you. All your videos are super helpful and fun to watch. Keep up the good work! :)"
792,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),"That new intro of yours does look really cool, I have to say! :D
I agree to the statement that DS has really changed over the past few years.
Because it is such a young field I think that the landscape will change dramatically even for the next 5-10 years.
My personal goal as a (now) first year university student is to stand out amongst my peers,
more than 50% of every CS student seems to be interested in ML, but only a very small percentage of those really
commit to the entire journey, which I really want to do.
Have a nice weekend :)"

795,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),I didn’t know about Kaggle micro courses. That will come in handy :) I have found that many people on Kaggle could have tough me a lot if they had documented their notebooks better. I learn a great amount by doing as much as possible from scratch at least once. Thanks for another good video :)
796,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),Hey ! All I want to say is... THANK YOU!  You have been mentoring me for quite some time now!

798,100K Channel Update + AMA Stream!,"would you recommend the new macbooks for data science? Im looking for a new laptop which a long battery life and lightweight, any recommendation here?"
799,100K Channel Update + AMA Stream!,"Hi Ken, while watching this video, I just realized that I'm now part of one data science community. Wow, thank you for bringing us all together! I'm looking forward to more of your videos about Kaggle projects. 

Lately, I found one very useful extension of jupyter notebook, TOC2, which automatically creates a table of contents with hyperlinks based on the headings. Its link: https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/toc2/README.html. Once you try it, I bet you will love it.

However, it's not available in Kaggle yet. The closest thing it has is to display the first level headings on the right in the reading mode. There's large room for improvement.

Louis posted in product feedback on Kaggle six months ago (https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/153519), but received little attention. What a pity! Can you help draw more attention and upvote it? If you have any other ideas, please let me know. I strongly believe that getting our sharing notebook well organized and more readable is very helpful for the community. TOC2 will make it much easier."

802,100K Channel Update + AMA Stream!,"This comment stood out to me the most: ""Maybe it's more about the critical mass of what you create than the growth of the videos"" (39:46). To me, it speaks to cultivating internal motivations, having an internal locus of control and understanding that above all else, you must do the work.

(And thanks for your answer to my questions, Ken. I can certainly appreciate the wisdom in planning in broad strokes and letting life fill in the details.)"

814,Uber Driver to Machine Learning Engineer in 9 Months! (@Daniel Bourke) - KNN EP. 05,"That is a very nice conversation... The points I like most are,
1. Trial and Error- try to do as many experiments as you can and reduce the time been them.
2. Rubberduck is the best one.
3. Three things- Smart, happy and useful. Also, things that might not work are used for learning.
4. Building skill, sharing work (Ken also say this very often as it is really essential.

Thank you to both of you..."

(@Daniel Bourke) - KNN EP. 05,"Learning how to learn and breakdown information was one of the best skills I obtained from my academic experience. Oddly, learning data science has been more rewarding thus far, mostly because of being self-reliant on myself and becoming independent. Not having a syllabus and everything planned/laid out in front of you is a skill in itself. It is great to be able to obtain the skills regardless of background as long as you put the work in. This means a lot to me as someone who was a first-gen student, and college isn't always attainable or even the right path. Now to advocate for internet accessibility across the U.S. and also the globe. Thank you both for the informative interview. I will be journaling my progress at the end of the day... we all could use some confidence and motivation."

862,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,Love this starting on this tomorrow.
863,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"I am seeing your videos from past few weeks and I even made an account on Kaggle and was trying to see what that Housing Project is all about. But after seeing it, i was overwhelmed and was questioning myself whether I'll be able to learn these things. Then, I started learning python basics and seeing your posts on LinkedIn where a lot of people talked about this initiative and now here I am seeing this videos and thinking of going this way. Maybe I'll be able able to understand what to do in that project after few weeks. #day1 #66daysofdata"
864,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,Let's do it.
865,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,Watching a data science video on YouTube was a good punch... Also if you don't mind can you share which background music you have used in the background because for me it is also helping me to stay connected...
866,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,Good morning.  I want to join the 66 days challenge in 2021. Please how do I follow up with the program
867,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"Hey! You mentioned that you will be using the 365 data science course, is it the same as the udemy (365 data science bootcamp 2020) or is it different?"

869,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"Hi @KenJee,

How to choose Data Science domain?

Things that should be kept in mind before choosing a domain.

Any suggestion will be a great help."
870,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"For statistics I would recommend the books of Geoff Cumming instead (abandon p-values and embrace confidence intervals!). 😉 If you're new, start with ""Introduction to the New Statistics"", otherwise have a look at ""Understanding the New Statistics"". His website is great with cool stuff www.thenewstatistics.com and he has also made some nice videos www.youtube.com/user/geoffdcumming/videos (check the Dance of p-values or Significance roulette)"

981,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"Hi Ken

Thank you so much, you came from havean for me.

I started learning just around a month ago (Im lost .....🤪)

for me as an electrical engineer (Industrial: oil & gas), data science like different planet.
my mathematical background is very strong, but coding experience is absolute zero.

I found myself really taken by data science.
For now, i focus only on Python, (we will see the rest after that)
check out freecodecamp.org, they have a very great program with free certificate. their YouTube videos made by university doctors

Great Job Hero🏆

Believe me, Im cheering for you man, like you made a triple points with a big dunk🏀.

1015,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,@Ken Jee what are basic kaggle projects to do and learn
1016,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,Discord will be great for this
1017,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"What a irony ken sir !
Every time I wanted anything you made a video on it and I get solution of my problems."
1018,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,Excited to join this with you. Hopefully 66 days becomes 6666 days :p
1019,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,Waiting for this from a Long time..👍🏻

1024,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"Hello Ken, great to see this. Do we have any prerequisites for this serie?
I have taken a Stats class, a Intro to Datascience class, and have some experience with R, is it enough to follow along. Thank you Ken 😁"
1025,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,Woo! Excited to follow along on this one :) Revising the basics will never be a bad idea. Let's do this!
1026,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,want to start data science in the right path show us ken
1027,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"Really looking forward to this!! I hope you can also touch upon how important it is to learn about deployment/pipelines, and if so, how we should go about it."
1028,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"I'm so excited for this, patiently waiting ✨"
1029,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,Just the thing I wanted.
1030,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"Speaking of which, related to my comment below, a message for the followers of Ken jee:
How about meeting on a regular basis on Kaggle and talking about our progresses? And, of course, help each other out, share notes and, even better, work together on a project once we're good enough one of these days? :)
PS: a discord chat with voice might also be useful, and I am willing to help establish it, just in case :)"
1031,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"I am already in the process of taking not just the habits of doing ML every day (that's a requirement I think when you're beginning and new in the field) but als, recently, I started using my Bullet Journal to record my investment and progress into the field. 
And since I am still trying to sort out a few things both in tracking my progress and trying to establish a clearer road map, seeing this on my computer this morning came as an incredibly great blessing, thank you !!  :)
Now question: Could you and us the rest of your community also have some discussion on, say, Kaggle on regular basis? I feel like that, for newcomers like me, it would help navigate the kaggle ""maelstrom"" and be less intimidated, as well as having a clearer road map.
As for you, it would help you both reexamine your fundemantals through teaching as well as helping you establish yourself as a good, proficient teacher that has both passion for the field and is teaching it with the best of intentions. :)
And I assume when we, your followers and students, start becoming proficient and say 'Ken Jee was instrumental in this' ... well ... I am really hoping this will open doors for you, the best ones, just saying ;)"
1032,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,super excited ....lets rock it ken
1033,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"Thanks for this amazing initiative, I would love to join, so much to learn, let me stock up on the books you suggested 😁"

1035,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"Why is Ken Jee playing dota for 66 days? 😂

Jokes aside. This is awesome. The value you give to the Data Science community is massive! Thank you very much 👊"
1036,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,Epic. much-awaited one
1037,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,So excited for this! Please guide us to the right path Ken Senpai!
1038,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"Wow, I'm just starting too. I'd love to join you on this. I'm currently working through the HarvardX cert (John Hopkin's lined up afterwards). I'll squeeze in your courses too as appropriate :)"

I recently acquire the knowledge of Python hope it will help me understand more efficiently.
Looking forward to it ......Thanks!!!"
1047,Why I'm Starting Data Science Over Again.,"sweet mother of all that is good and pure!
Hello Ken, could you also mention the  important topics to learn sequence wise, 
like i am really confused about embeddings and models like BERT,GLOVE etc.
it would really help if you could explained "" where they will be used "" with few example in the video.

Thanks. 
Eagerly Waiting."

1502,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 2 (Data Collection),"Hello Ken, Thanks for uploading this helpful series. It is really helping me understand the basics very well! :) 



I had a question about data collection. Is data collection supposed to be a one-time process or does it have to be repeated over when the data in the source has changed? Taking the example of glassdoor, the data around salary will change over time, so how do we decide how often we should re-collect the data? And what if the website structure changes so often and hinders the scraping process? For example, this data scrapper code we referenced doesn't work very well if I run it now as many locators have changed, so I would also have to keep up with the changes in the glassdoor web structure. How to mitigate this problem?"
1503,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 2 (Data Collection),"Hello Ken! I am a student pursuing their Data Science bachelors (I was doing computer systems, but you and Tina inspired me. Also, my college introduce this major a year ago and I always had an interest in ML) and I came across your videos! I think they're awesome and I am actually trying out this project with you and my goal is to do it on my own after I have the complete understanding. I am a Lower Level Junior, and I'll be the first person ever in my family to graduate from college! While I am doing this project, when I try to run the scraper, I get an error (NoSuchElementException: no such element: Unable to locate element: {""method"":""css selector"",""selector"":"".selected""}
  (Session info: chrome=88.0.4324.182)), do you think you or anyone in the community can help me out with this problem? I hope this isn't overstepping any boundaries, I just really want to learn. I'll say my skills is over tutorial purgatory but still not confident to be considered ""intermediate"". Thank you very much!"
1504,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 2 (Data Collection),"This is huge; exactly what I was hoping to find because I couldn't visualize what a data science project really even means, where to start, etc - I'm learning on my own. I greatly appreciate the unedited process for tweaking the scraper. That stuff could be passed off as a bullet point ""collect data"", but we all know that even folks that do this daily spend some time going through what you went though in this video.

I also try to look it up on google but I didn't find anything helpful. I also tried to use another operating system to see if the web driver was not working well in windows. Also, I read all the comments to find if other people are having that issue. And there are quite a lot with the same problem. Could you help me? I'm trying to pull more data so that I can use Keras and get better predictions. Thank you!"
1591,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 2 (Data Collection),Do we actually need to know the purpose of each line  of copied Selenium code or we can just copy and paste it as it is ?

What seems to be happening (based on the message and looking at the screen as it attempts to scrape) is that the code is either not properly able to exit from the 'Sign Up' pop-up or maybe it's not able to click on a posting. 

I've been scratching my head at this for a while now and I'm really stuck. I'm using your code now directly from your GitHub. Anything you recommend trying? I love this series and am finding it very helpful but would love to follow along."

1604,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 2 (Data Collection),"Thank you very much. The way you faced and solved the bugs is unique and inspirational. Some other videos out there are too well-prepared, which is easy to delude people into the perfectness of the code. Consequently, if the code somehow does not run, people don't know how to solve.

Would it be OK to say to use someone else's code and provide credit for it? look forward to seeing this entire series as I'm currently in my own project-building phase for my data scientist career transition.
1642,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 2 (Data Collection),This is my first comment on youtube since I am using computer/Internet and It's for you Ken. You have started such a great super awesome series ( Data Science Project from Scratch ) that most of youtubers have'nt and I love it. You are such a great man.  Your Videos are very informative. I believe this series will give your channel more and more subscribers.

1655,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"So basically is it modest to say that the silver bullet to get into a good role is:
➡️to have had Software Engineer/Development education + experience

Else
➡️to have been submerged  in roles in your current situation (sometimes very unlikely) analyst to scientist
➡️if none of the above, then to get either of the three things (recommended but not required) but without a work portfolio (professional or otherwise) it is intensively hard"

1663,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hello Ken! I'm a fresh grad a BA in math and minor in statistics and would really like to break into the data world. I've been self studying for several month now and have some grasp of python (np, pandas, plt) and sql. Despite knowing the technical I feel like I'm struggling with the domain knowledge and when and how to apply statistical methods to my work. Would you recommend me bootcamp to shore up my weaknesses and have a support system to assist me with job finding. Money and time is mostly not an issue."
1664,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey Ken. Nice video. I am an experienced economist. I have a a BA and MA  in economics and finance. I have worked for 8 years in economics and econometrics. This basically entails extensive data analysis and statistics around economic issues, so I am very good with statistics, regressions, inference, and causality (a big thing in econometrics). However, in economics we mostly use Stata as the go to software. I am really interested in shifting to data science as I have a huge passion for data analysis. I need to learn the languages commonly used in data science (R, python…) but I am strong on the statistical background. Any insights on what’s best and where to start keeping in mind that I am currently a full-time economist. So the transition has to be gradual or more like a side-hustle in the beginning. Thanks"
1665,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Hey Ken will love if you could update this video for 2022. I am petroleum Engineer and in general I see the application of ML growing exponentially within the field. Not sure if you have anyone in your network that could advise on the transition. I personally been doing MOOC’s and undecided on doing the  MSc while working.
1666,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, I majored in data analytics for my undergrad and have some work experience as a data analyst as well as a junior data scientist. I'd like to transition into the data science side of things and I was actually admitted into a masters program at the university where I completed my undergrad. The cost of tuition however is far too high for me to afford would a bootcamp be the next best choice because of my background?"
1667,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,How can boost my skills with out internship ?
1668,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Hi Ken ! I ' ve graduated from Communication and Media Studies. I have some basic practical skills in programming with Python. In your opinion what should I choose? A Bootcamp or a master?
1669,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Hey Ken I’ve just finished my bsc in international business and would be starting my masters in data science in a few months. I don’t have much of a quantitative background and was wondering if I would find the masters difficult?
1670,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hello Ken, thank you for a really insightful video. You got a sub. I am doing my PhD in Chemistry and would graduate next year. Do you have any tips and starting point for me?"
1671,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Do you have any bootcamp recommendations?
1672,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"hi ken, thank you for your all useful videos, honesty you should teach too, got a question for you, I'm 39 and taking my data science certification now and planning to get to data science bootcamp, would love to know what do you think? is that a good idea to take bootcamp right after my certification?"
1673,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey great video, very informative...I have a question for you. What would you say to someone looking to get a bachelor's in data science? I'm in my 30's with no degree, my local university (UCCS in Colorado springs) has a bachelors program in data science, and honestly I feel like it would a lot of sense for me to take that route. I, like you mentioned about yourself, need structure around the learning/schedule of it all for me to succeed. Knowing most positions in data science require(or greatly prefer) a masters/PhD, I think a bachelor's degree in the field would be a great place to start, right? I'd be curious to hear opinions/thoughts on this. Was bachelor's just not included in this comparison because it's not as commonly offered? Thanks :)"
1674,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, recently started watching your videos. Very interesting and helpful content. I am a 31 year old who is going for his Masters Degree in Design to the US in a couple of months. I have an engineering background but I have mostly worked in the social sector and storytelling space. I am interested in Data Science because of the strong career possibilities but also the problem solving abilities. I also believe that as someone in the art and design space with command over Data Science principles I will be able to do more. Out of all these what would you suggest I undertake? My Masters program is 2 years long and while it will be rigorous I think I will be able to make time to study Data Science."
1675,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, thanks for your detailed insights on what to expect. I'm looking into a Bootcamp but have little to no experience in the field. Should you recommend that I still do it?"
1676,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Thank you for sharing your insights.

I am a working professional in the chemical industry (14 years experience) 
with an applied/pure mathematics degree and am at this point of decision making. I have been accepted into my local accredited university for their Masters of Data Science program. I have also been accepted into GaTech’s Data Science boot camp, and am currently doing the Google Certification to get some bearings.

I really don’t want to wait the 3.5 years it would take to get my masters to enter into this field and would rather start into an entry job at least before I work on my degree, but I also don’t have much of the specific data experience from my current position to get me there.

Do you believe a math degree along with the bootcamp would carry weight? do you know any colleagues that took a similar route? I feel that my math background allows me to be more than capable for the job, but convincing an employer of this without certs or anything else under my belt is a challenge. I am also open to obtaining my Masters while working in data, I’m all about continuing education.

Any opinions and advisement are appreciated."
1677,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey thanks for the insightful video.
I am a student of Computer Engineering, recently discovered my interest in data science. What would you suggest me? Should I go for a degree or learn by Google data analytics certificate?
I have to do a mandatory internship so I was thinking about learning by certificate course and applying for internships for role of data analyst."
1678,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Hey what do you think about the wgu masters in data science it’s tuition is quite cheap and is competency based.
1679,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,What do you think about the OSU boot camp?
1680,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Perfect video I'm considering that now!
1681,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken Jee,
Thank you for your amazing videos. Im transitioning from a business consultant role and am planning on doing a bootcamp followed by a Masters immediately to finish next year. Do you think this would tick enough boxes to really digest as much knowledge in the most efficient way. The money isnt a big issue - im in Europe and its somewhat cheaper than N America"
1682,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,@KenJee - thanks for this video - nice one! What would you recommend for a manager/director who has data science team under their org chart? What kind of path should they pursue?
1683,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, thanks for the video. Just wondering, when you talk about the DS Masters, would that be a post-grad for general grad applicants (from different backgrounds), rather than data/software specific? I'm doing Maths (DA, Ops, Stats) and CS (ML) dual degrees... would that be sufficient, in terms of college qualifications, for most jobs (those not specifying PhD etc)? thanks"
1684,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Great video! Could you make a video reviewing couple of online certificates or courses, and some bootcamps? I think that’d really help out someone like me who’s just starting out and trying to make the best decision possible. Thanks you."
1685,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"I am currently doing BBA program in Marketing and I will pursue an
MBA program in Marketing as well, however I learned a lot about
data analysis (mostly in excel and spss) and a freelancer as data
analyst in fiverr.
currently enrolled myself in google professional data analytics.
Frankly speaking, data science feels fascinating to me and I want to
learn this as well.
Now, my question is if I self teach data science to myself, will this
bring more chances of me getting into a top position of a
corporate?
will these skills as plus point in my career ?
will these added skills make me stand out than others among my
competitors ?
if I pursue another master's in data science will that add more
value to my resume?"
1686,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey Ken awesome video, there is so much (sometimes conflicting) information out there about data science, it's nice to see you break it down. I just got admitted to Tufts for a master in data science with thesis. My undergrad is in electrical engineering. Just wondering if you know anything about the Tufts programs or would know what to anticipate in terms of career outcomes after graduation?"
1687,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Data science bootcamp advantage = you are working with an actual data science instead of an academic.
1688,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, what would you suggest if I have a Bachelors degree double major in Economics and Business already? Would a certificate be a better option in terms of landing a job at the end than what you mentioned in the video? Thanks!"
1689,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Data Science Certificate is a waste.
1690,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Thanks for watching everyone! Although not explicitly mentioned in the title, I highly recommend exploring the self taught route. There are plenty of great online resources out there for you to use.

1692,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Aye man I’m thinking about applying for a Washington university data analytics boot camp for under a little under 13k for 24 weeks. I have no experience and but they go over most things in the field. Mentioned about helping with resumes and landing my first job. Also said that they would aid me with the degree if I choose to go further.
1693,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Hello :) Thanks for your videos I really love them. I'll graduate this summer and I'll have a master's degree in pharmacy. Right now I'm really interested in Data Science I've started a course on Dataquest and I really enjoy it. Do you think a person like me with a pharmacy degree could be useful in the field of Data Science? If yes I think maybe a Bootcamp would be useful for me.
1694,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"#63: Aha!!!! Right timing for this video, I'm really happy to find it!!! 
I'm making a decision now, not an easy decision so was great to see the Pros and Cons.
I think you don't mention in the title of this one the SELF STUDY as the 4th option, which has great insights!

1695,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hello Ken thanks for your advices. What do you think about reading books instead of those options ? I'm finishing the electronics engineering and I would like to work as a data scientist. I've already been reading a couple of books, but I don't know if it is going to be enough. 
Thanks!"
1696,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"There's certificates and then there's certificates, right? How does the UC Berkeley Extension Certificate in Data Science stack up?"
1697,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey Ken, is diploma of 1 year is sufficient  to get job??"
1698,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,How to do good project portfolio
1699,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Thank you Ken this helps a lot. I am a recent graduate engineer who is planning to change my career into data science. I just wondering if you can suggest how should I build a portfolio?
1700,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,I do wonder if a certificate would be good if you are already trained in an administrative capacity and they are interested in someone who can do front desk work and a little bit of data analysis. I work in the arts and have an arts degree but I want to branch out in an admin a bit.
1701,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Really nice video Ken.  I got my Ph.D. in chemical engineering and recently I'm considering switching my career into the data science field. I have already finished several courses (mostly from Coursera) on ML, SQL, NLP, CV, etc. My current research job only involves simple regression tasks (mostly doable with Scikit-learn, rarely using TensorFlow) with small datasets. I am considering a bootcamp to improve my portfolio, and I am wondering if you can recommend a few good ones (not sure if it is ok for you to say the program names publicly)."
1702,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,I'm considering enrolling into a bootcamp. My only reservation is that I only have my associates degree at the moment. I am currently working on my bachelor's in computer science. Is it even worth it until I have at least my bachelor's?
1703,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"These are pretty solid tips.  I went through a similar journey since I'm already working and need structured learning. In 2017, I looked at MS CS and MS Data Science programs under $20K that are still decent. What I've seen is Georgia Tech OMSCS ($8,000), Illinois University MS Data science ($21,000), and Indiana University MS Data Science ($21,000).  I failed with my application to Illinois.  I got into OMSCS, I failed my 1st 2 classes and, projected to stay here for a long time. The average class students take is around 1.2 subjects/sem, with a failure rate of about 45%.  I'm finishing up my IU MS Data Science, and hard to find a job still.  What I got is Data Visualization and Management at Ernst and Young (and a lot of my cohorts are still struggling to find work, but easy to get an internship).  If you get into Ga tech OMSCS, it's easier to find job.  OMSCS is data science heavy degree. Subjects include ML, AI, HCI, Computer Vision, ML for Trading, etc.  We even have AI TA's with top-notch teachers and cohorts."
1704,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, I'm really enjoying your videos and aspire to be a data scientist in the environmental field. I'm currently working as a data analyst but my projects continually involve just data cleaning/formatting in python and vizualization in tableau. I would like to transition to a data science position where I am able to use machine learning. Do you have any advice for making the transition from a data analyst to a data scientist. I'm reading a textbook on statistical learning to get an understanding of theory but not sure where to go from there. Thank you for making these videos!"
1705,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Why is he jacked
1706,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"I'm currently an undergrad sophomore. I'm majoring math and might minor DS. In this case, do you recommend grad school or bootcamp?"
1707,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,What about boot camp and masters together? 🤔🤔
1708,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi ken, I have a professional health science background-very little computer science or math. However currently doing a PhD in which I am building health prediction models which required intermediate level statistics and some programming in R and SPSS. Do you have any advice that could improve my trajectory into a DS role after my PhD?"
1709,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, for the project portfolio that you mentioned, has it to be published online?"
1710,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, i want to jump into data science field. My Way to pursue into Data Science field with enroll with 365 Career in udemy course. After i finished with this, i will continue with enroll more courses related with ML and DL. DO you have any comments or inputs for me? Thanks"
1711,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken! I'm new to your channel.. thanks for everything!
I have an economics background but no professional technical experience. Based on the video, it sounds like you'd recommend a masters degree over a bootcamp. I'm wondering your take on why a bootcamp may not be sufficient in getting a data science or analytics job? Not much of a portfolio here, but is that not something you can build out when doing a bootcamp?"
1712,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Volunteer work where in America is that?
1713,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Can I mention 1 data science bootcamp that is good? thanks
1714,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, I was graduated with a Finance bachelor's degree two years ago and I'm working at a bank right now. I want to move into a data analyst role, but I'm confused about how to get started. All the data science master degrees would require a mathematics or computer science undergraduate as a pre-requirement, so is it a certificate or bootcamp that would be more suitable for me? I'm studying online courses with 365 data now, but what would be my next step? Thank you so very much!!"
1715,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey Ken, thanks for making this video. I’ll be starting a Masters in mental health counseling this coming fall, but I did always have an affinity towards the data-heavy classes I had in undergrad. I definitely feel drawn to counseling, but perhaps a certificate wouldn’t be a bad idea for exploratory reasons, as you’d said:) Much appreciated!"
1716,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hello, I just finished my Second BA in statistics( the other being economics). I’m considering a master in “statistical theory and machine learning”. Would this be a good fit for someone looking to get into the data science field ?"
1717,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey ken , I am a 3rd year computer science undergraduate student. And over these years i have taught my self some of the foundations of Data Science. And I was thinking of doing  a masters in data science . But i checked the syllabus of most of the data science Masters and i found out that i have the foundations of most of those courses. So i was thinking if it's the right masters for me?
I'm also keeping an option to do Masters in AI. Since most of data science and AI courses are same . But i think that AI is more Advanced. So please can you guide me?"
1718,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Thanks Ken! I’m 53 and am currently a data analyst with mostly DB skills. We merged into a hospital system and I need updated analytics skills. I’ll have a job. Just need the best skills. What do you recommend in my case?
1719,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Very helpful.. I have a PhD in systems science and industrial engineering and I'm familiar with all data science/coding topics. But I'm struggling with finding jobs I feel I need to strengthen my skills. What do you think?
1720,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey I have a Bachelors in Mathematics and I was lookin got take a Data science bootcamp , would you say that my quantitative background along with the projects I would make from my bootcamp would help myself look appealing to some employers ?"
1721,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,hey Ken what is your opinion on online masters compared to traditional masters program
1722,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"What is your opinion on those of us with 20 years of software engineering backgrounds learning ML as a compliment to our careers. Specifically,  the job prospects aspect for folks in that position?"
1723,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,@Ken Jee what do you think about Data Science master's program offered by big universities like the one given by UMICH at Coursera? Will they be a waste of time or will they greatly help enter the data science industry ?
1724,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Data science and big data are overrated and being fashionable is expensive. Data science is new, they teach some statistics, programming and databases. Computer science or mathematics is the right profile to have a solid foundation."
1725,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,In case it's helpful for anyone: I'm in Oregon State University's Data Analysis Program and was doing Sales (groan) before. You can either cash out halfway through for a Certificate (for about $12k) or go full Master's (for about $25k). I'm about halfway through. I tried the Udemy and self-learning approach and an actual school is totally worth the money in my eyes. The use cases you work with are more compelling and rigorously assessed than free / cheap stuff I found online. You're also bombarded with concepts each week which gives you a lot of bang for your buck; usually I learn just enough to pass the class then really try to internalize it via independent projects after. I'm planning on a more portfolio-based entryway into a position that recoups what I paid for school and whether my anecdotal advice is even worth listening to probably hinges on how successful that ends up being ;o) but thus far I have been very happy with academic learning (and I'm not someone who likes college!)
1726,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hello, I am sort of late to the game in finding your video.  Any thoughts on where someone with related degrees BS (Analytical Chemistry) and an MBA (Finance) might fall?"
1727,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Concise and informative sharing!!! Thanks
1728,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"I have a bachelors degree in Business Analytics. throughout the curriculum we were always discussing data science and used Python, R, SQL, and AWS.  Do you think a data science certificate would pair well with this and increase my chances of employment in this field?"
1729,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Really great, informative channel! This guy is cute!"
1730,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"I'm a Data Science engineering student, currently looking to what certificates should I focus on getting during my 3 academic years so I can have a better resume, any ideas ? :'("
1731,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Great advice as always!
1732,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Lol. which one for someone in there 40's with no work experience, only an AS degree. But who has been programming since they where a child, and never been payed for it.. Who also can and has already built tensorflow, keras, pytorch and from-scratch models?

It's so annoying to me when videos like this assume everyone watching must have a Bachelors degree already."
1733,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Hey ken loved your video it was very informative this maybe a little unusal story but I have a degree in criminal justice and I would like to have an immediate career change and i was looking into data science/ data analysis which intersted me on how much you can do. I am currently taking on a certificate in data science to see if i am interested and i was wondering how can you create a stand out portfolio  for employers with little to no experience in coding or computer science? Also will learning data science help get  foot in the door into a data analysis position working on programs like R or sql?
1734,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Any mechanical engineering structural analysts here with work experience? What are you upselling from this experience?
1735,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey Ken, I have a 2 year gap while trying for a job from my mechanical degree. It didn't yield me. Now I am shifting in Data Science field. So what would you suggest I do? I already done few courses on Udemy and now I can say I'm familiar with some breath of this field. Now what should I do, will it be necessary in my case two do master in data science or boot-camp OR would just building portfolio and having one or two internship would get  me a job?"
1736,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,I am a QA for 10 years and taking MS in Computer science with focus on Machine Learning. Do I have a chance of getting or successfully transitioning to a career change?
1737,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Please share more about personal projects. I have started one but I am not really sure how it should look like at the end and how I should promote it.
1738,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Ken, thank you for the information. I am leaning towards a masters course. Further to your discussion, what are your thoughts on getting certified via MS, or AWS, compared to a master degree. To put it in context, I have a accounting/ finance research background."
1739,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"IBM data science specialization could land you a job if you also take an applied data science and deep learning specialization... All that could potentially take between 1 - 2 years, depending on your commitment. What do you think?"
1740,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Another question, if we have the funds to pay for a Data Science degree at say Maryville University on line but it is not a masters do you feel that is okay? The other option is for my son to finish his current B.A. in PHHP at the University of Florida and move forward to the Post Baccalaureate degree to get the additional credits needed. He would then move on to the B.A. in  C.S. and finish that degree. One is longer and a Public University the other is Private, but I belive  he can obtain what he needs in Maryville. This is the trade off and frankly he hates the PHHP bachelor's and has 3 more semesters and I would like him to just move on. One is more time, One is more money. Please help with advice."
1741,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"We have been watching YouTube videos for months...you have the best advice! Thank you for answers, this will help us set our son on the right path forward...much appreciated! Better than the academic advisors at the Universities, I think they have a job to do for the institution and sometimes the truth can not be told or advised. Sorry to express that but you have to follow the ""Money Trail""."
1742,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,So what do you think about a B.A. in CS?
1743,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"So..you think you might want to do a B.A. in Computer Science, would a boot camp help prepare you for that Degree."
1744,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Good info...what do you mean by a quantitative background?.
1745,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, I’m an architect, I design buildings. I tested out of math in college. I’m really into computers and very proficient with 3D modeling. I want to switch careers and become a data scientist. What do you think would be the best path for me?"
1746,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hello Ken, Thanks for your sound advice. I have a quick question. I am a snr manager with over 18 years of experience. Does it make sense for me to take up a Masters degree in AI and ML at this stage? I am 43 year old with an operations management background in BPO, KPO, call centers etc. I have no programming language background although my maths was pretty strong back then. What do you advise? Thanks in advance."
1747,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Lets say i am totally ignorant about this field and i start putting 7 hours a days into learning. How long till i get an internship or a job?
1748,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Wow!  Great in depth video. Thanks for explaining all of the pros and cons and what fits different personalities and backgrounds.

1751,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Very helpful. Thanks for giving such an in-depth breakdown.
1752,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,I'm interested in Data science and I'm transferring from BS in architecture technology to applied mathematics. Is it better to join a bootcamp like Flation school or spend does years studying applied mathematics? I would not mind getting a low position in data science or data analyst role.
1753,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi ken, loved the content you have been putting out regarding DS, I have some doubts regarding my situation since its quite specific and I wanted to get your opinion.

I was going to start my undergrad as an Engineer in Data and Mathematics but I have decided to wait one more year so that I can study in Germany (I live in Mexico so returning here with with a German title will allow me to secure a job with ease). In the mean time I have been considering possibly switching majors to something like Economics, or Physics. I have thought of becoming a DS for two years now, however I am worried that the Job opportunities DS promises might shrink and that my degree might limit me the amount of jobs I can find in comparison to the other degrees I am interested in. I am not the best at coding however I have been told that as long as I know how to properly query with SQL (which I can) and have a good exposition of my data, I should be fine. Although I know I would enjoy my time studying something like Economics I feel like it would be really easy for me and I would only want to get in degree in something I struggle with so that I have a more complete profile when I enter the corporate world.

TLDR: I really enjoy the implications of being a DS and want a challenging major, but I don't know if Im cut out to be one and might consider just doing a Masters after an undegrad in something else."
1754,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Will you consider making a video about putting together a project portfolio website? It would be really helpful!
1755,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey Ken, your down-to-basics and straightforward approach to the explaining data science and learning it are very confidence-inspiring to someone trying to get into the field. I have a background somewhat in statistics in that I graduated with an undergrad in psychology but with a focus on statistics. I did 3 quantitative and 1 qualitative study in undergrad and I think I have some chance of using that to my advantage. I'm working currently to pay the bills and keep needs like health insurance available and I'm currently starting the self-study method. I've binged through a few videos and I'm going to try ""ultralearning"" data science, but I'm really not sure where to go from there. I'm going to try to build a good portfolio but I feel like if I just try to say"" I have a degree in psych buut it's with a focus on psych stats"" and then get just a cert or a bootcamp then it won't be worth it for anybody looking to hire. Getting a masters is always on the table but like you said that's a big time and money commitment for no guarantee of a career out of the gate. In the end I think the connections of a bootcamp are more beneficial for me but I also don't want to shell out cash to find out that method would not make me look as good on a resume compared to a degree program. Do you think a psych degree is a handicap or something I can still leverage?"
1756,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"I have enrolled for this course and I am currently undergoing the rigors of it. It would be great if you could check out the curriculum and let me know if this would be helpful and whether it is at par with industry standards. To be honest, this Masters program just scratches the surface but I have found it to be interesting so far:

1757,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey Ken, I am in the process of changing my major from a B.S. in Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) to Data Science as the ROI (Return on Investment) is sub par in SLP and I have discovered many interesting facets associated with Data Science. I have to take some prereqs before I can apply to my university's B.S. in Data Science program. However, I became concerned as you mentioned that Data Science COULD become oversaturated even if I have a Master's degree (SLP is too since they'll take anyone ranging from pre-med to Underwater Basket Weaving). Will I keep a high-paying job if I make this transition now and have a few years of experience after earning a grad degree, or should I do the following: 1) B.S. in Data Science with Actuarial Science Minor 2) B.A. or B.S. in Stats with a Minor in Computer Science 3) Pick something in tech, business, econ/finance, or another field. After learning from the recent pandemic and reevaluating my college career, I have surmised that I want to do a tech, math, computer, business, or finance/econ-based job from home. I was misled (many of my classmates as well) by those in SLP and believed I could do work from home, but just like many majors they use work-from-home as a marketing strategy and omit info that there are many strings attached to this premise."

I have a lot of math in my background and some coding though, and can get into a masters. I work for a giant lab right now and think I can manage to get some collaborations if I go into this to practice. I saw the Georgia Tech MS in analytics and it would fit perfectly. However, I do want to be employable and not just literate, would this be a good idea? I can afford it, I work full time so it works for me, and taking 1-2 courses a semester would work for me because I really want structure"

https://www.edvancer.in/course/data-science-specialization/

Thanks in advance"
1761,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, great content. I am torn between certificates and bootcamp. I have PhD in Materials Science and masters in both Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering (2 masters). I was a very happy Data Analyst when COVID Crisis hit (the industry was aviation so yeah...). I also have some experience with six sigma, lean manufacturing and production as well.

What would you advise a person like me? 

I was thinking about getting a bunch of certificates - those offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera seem to be ok (as opposed to IBM Data Science course - this one sucks), also Coursera has several courses organized by Google, AWS, Mongo DB, etc that seem interesting, as they prove presence of some practical skills in real industry used tools. 

What do you think is the better option - bootcamp or a collection of certificates? I leaning towards collection of certificates - this means I don't have to go through the basics of Python programming again, and in the price of the bootcamp (say 2500 usd) I can get some interesting collection of new skill certificates or deepen those I feel need deepening."
1762,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Can you recommend which bootcamp to take if I want an as-close-to-realworld sort of assignment? I'm also very interested to learn the deployment part of data science, like, having my model on a cloud that can be consumed via api, with this whole thing as a docker image, etc

thanks"
1763,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Hi Ken. I am sure you have answered this question 1000s of times. Sorry. But what data science certification/program would you recommend for me if I am about to pursue a Ph.D. in the health/medical/physiology side of things. I keep seeing 365Datascience...is that a good one to go with?
1764,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey Ken, regarding getting a Masters Degree, I am confused on which to pursue (MS Data Science, MS Stats and Data Science, MS Information Technology). I want to get into a Data Science career path but I am worried that Data Science would be a fad and I would be struggling to land jobs upon graduation. Most of the job descriptions for a data scientist I encountered requires MS in Computer Science, Statistics, etc"

I have a job in management consulting starting in January and am looking to strengthen my data skills. Which of these (If any) would be best for me?"
1771,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Great video, Ken. This is insightful."
1772,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey Ken, really informative video, thanks. I'm a 29 year old accountant looking to make the move into data science/artificial intelligence. I'm looking at doing a part time masters over 2 years in Computer science & Artificial intelligence from a good university in England. My original degree was in economics so I have a bit of a statistical/mathematical background. If I build a portfolio of projects over the 2 years what do you think my chances will be of landing a decent data science job once I graduate? Thanks."
1773,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken. I'm looking to transition into data science over the course of the next year or two if possible. I have around 8 years experience in digital media, so there is somewhat of a narrative of ""data analysis"" that I can build on - though that analysis was limited to digital media analytics platforms. The job has given me an edge in terms of communication, presentation-building, etc., but that's where my advantages end. My undergrad is in a non-quantitative major (sport management). I have zero calculus at this time. I spent the first 3 years of my career in sales. And I cannot afford to take an internship at any point throughout the remainder of my career.

I'm currently taking the Data Analysis nanodegree program with Udacity, and getting a really good handle on the analytics toolkit. The programming is coming easier than I expected. From there I was thinking of self-studying the math, and doing the Udacity Data Science nanodegree to start to get the DS foundation. I think I have a reasonable shot of moving into the analytics department at my current agency within the next year. I can start to build a DS portfolio around that time as well. 

With that context - do you suggest I go masters, boot camp, certificate, or continued self-study after that?"
1774,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey Ken, can you recommend the best universities to get a master's degree in DS?"
1775,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey Ken,
How would you treat the udacity nanodegrees as, inbetween bootcamp and certificates or more towards the certificate side??

For my situation I have an electrical eng background with some minor programming exp, off the top off my head I'd probably upskill in statistics and programming on top of the data science skills to build my foundation, right?"
1776,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken. Thank you for posting this. I am looking to transition into the Data Science world. I am strongly considering going to a bootcamp. I am curious to know what your thoughts are:

 I have a BA in Psychology, have TAed statistics courses. But I have been out of the field for a bit. I am hoping that a bootcamp will help me to quickly learn the skills that will eventually lead me to a job. I am nervous that employers won't take me seriously with only a BA."
1777,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,What about Masters on Coursera?
1778,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"You are super awesome for making this video!

I have a history degree (feel free to laugh at me lol), and no documented math backround except that my job in real estate required making and reviewing budgets. I'm really hoping to land an analyst role after a bootcamp.... praying I won't need a bachelors"
1779,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, I think you're the best guy I can ask this question. I have one year left in the Master of ""Economic Analysis & Modelling"" in Rabat, Morocco. I am familiar with Excel, R, and statistical packages like EViews & SPSS, but I was rejected from many Data Analyst internships in the US. So for now I started an internship in Morocco, where I basically make a questionnaire for a certain sampe, collect data, and analyse results. I have been also learning Python and Tableau because they were mentioned in the requirements of most Data analyst internships. Do you think I can land an internship next spring in the US with my anticipated level. Also how was the evolution of Data Analyst jobs and internships impacted by Covid 19. Thanks a bunch & God Bless u."
1780,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey Ken. I really appreciate your videos. I've been studying Data Science, Statistics and coding, and I feel a little lost about how to build a portfolio. Can you suggest me or give me some hints of how to do that?"

1787,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, 
This year i will go to college and i'm between a Data Science degree and Computer Science degree. I want to pursue a career in Data Science. I already now some languages of programming (mainly  Python, JS, C and a bit of R)  but i'm afraid that the programming aspect that the Data Science degree has will not be sufficient for the future and also i'm afraid that the Computer Science degree will not give the necessary skills for a data science career such as analysis, statistics etc
I'd like to know if you think that a Data Science degree is worth it or if a Computer Science is better. Thank you and i love your content keep it up."
1788,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken,

I am a Mechanical Engineer for seven years. I don’t have a lot of experience in programming or data science. I am looking at taking Bootcamp for Data Sciences at USC, but it is an offer by Trilogy. I got into the program within two days of applying. I try to do research for the validity of the certificate, and statistic of the students who would get a job in data science after the programs. I don’t find a lot of information. 

I am wondering if my best bet is to go to a Master's Degree in Data Sciences?"
1789,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hello Ken Jee, I have Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and I'm currently working as an engineer for piping company. I am also doing master's degree (online) in IT. I'm eventually trying to get into Data Science. Is getting AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty certification  good enough to land a Data Science job considering I have a master's degree in IT?"
1790,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Thanks. Really appreciate the breakdown. Looking into exploring into DS, and this has been the best breakdown of the pro and cons if each option. Thanks Ken."
1791,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"I have a MSc. Mathematics/Statistics. Been trying to land a job in the stats field since I graduated but no luck. Thinking of taking data science to become a data analyst. Planned to take a Master's degree in Data Science but have to forego because there's no scholarship available due to this horrid pandemic. Just started a free data science online course on Kaggle. My question is, am I on the right path? Is it really possible for me to become a data analyst through this path? Hope you can share your insight. I'm so desperate tbh because I just lost my job recently due to this horrible pandemic ㅠㅠ"
1792,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"I went to indeed and started researching the local job market, Nashville, for data scientists. Every job required a MS in data science. I immediately can to YouTube and found your video. My intent was to take Harvard's online DS certificate program due to its low cost. Base on what you said in this video I am just going to scrap the idea of becoming a data scientist. You confirmed what I found in my job research on indeed. I am a mechanical engineer and I also have a degree physics. I assumed that this would be a seamless transition. I currently make 6 figures in my current role.  I am not looking to take a hit in salary for an super entry level job as a data scientist if I can even land this role due to the requirements employers are looking for. SMH back to the drawing board."
1793,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Ken Jee,
I’m about to start my senior year of college and I’m majoring in physics and math, and I’m starting to get really interested in data science. I’m currently working a research internship in medical physics, and I’m using python with numpy, pandas, etc. to analyze how the accuracy of CT scanners changes from week to week. Even though this internship hasn’t had me use any physics so far, I’ve found the analysis very interesting. I would really like to get a job in data science without going to graduate school. What would you recommend that I do in the next year while I finish up college to best prepare me to land a job? I go to Texas A&M, so we have a huge network, but I don’t know where to start (other than using the kaggle courses). I’ve tried looking at job postings and it seems like all the jobs require a masters degree and/or 4+ years of experience. Thank you!"
1794,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hello Ken, thanks for your insight. I am a master's degree holder in aeronautical engineering (engine propulsion). If I were self taught, do I have a chance of getting a job in the data science industry?"
1795,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Thank you so much, Ken. Your video is actually helpful!"
1796,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Considering that I am now 45 and looking to begin a masters in data science program this fall since my current masters in exercise science has not yielded any sort of suitable or gainful employment, I'd be more than content to find an entry level data analyst role upon graduation from a data science program. Although I have done a handful of projects and have started building a portfolio, I'm hopeful that my chances of getting an internship, landing an entry level data analyst role, or associate data analyst role while going through this master's will be increased.  It's as if I feel starting this masters program will help give me that extra edge to at least obtain the most entry  level position in data analysis versus just my current degree and portfolio. I say this because it seems most job listings require or prefer some kind of quantitative degree, and exercise science does not seem to make the cut. There seems to be too much of a question as to landing an entry level data analyst job even with a much more robust portfolio which I'm sure I could have by year's end."
1797,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Hello! I have a masters in molecular biology and i am interesting in getting into the field of data science not to completely switch career but to help me get more opportunities with analyzing big data in biology. Do you of any resources specific to that? Also what do you think of DataCamp and their career paths?
1798,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"I'd like to do a bootcamp or a certificate, but I can't pay those out of pocket so I'm just sticking with Masters cause job kinda got screwed cause of covid lockdown 🙃"

How would rate a certificate like this?"
1806,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, I am senior level employee working in finance, but I started gain interest in developing my data skills however being my age, committingg to a master degree will be something I have to think twice, however I have been learning on my own. I found some good and useful course online, and it is really cheap option for me to get started, but I want to get deeper and broader about it, getting a job being a data scientist is not my goal here, my goal is to being an BI Consultant like I am pretty good with Power BI and Tableau, but also possible other tools. what you say mate?"
1807,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,should one get a masters in DS even though you are more interested in Data Analytics and are already an expert with SQL and Power BI? I feel like MSC in DS gives you a better chance to land a Data Analyst role than those without it.

1812,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey you, Ken! Really nice channel you have here. You've got one more subscriber. =)
.
Here in Brazil we have this kind of discussion every day. And for the ones who is not from the field, but really passionate about data and the math behind it - and of course have enough time to do so -, won't you recommend a second bachelor related to the field? For example: Statistics, Computer Science, Mathmatics, and so on? 
.
Briefly, I think for the tools, softwares, programming languages there are no better place to learn them than in online courses. Thus, the bachelor would give us the theory we need and in parallel sharp our skills with online courses. 
.
I'm curious to know your opinion about it. Cheers from Brazil, buddy!"

School can be partially covered by my employer. I was thinking about moving into an analytics or data engineering role at my hospital. Would that be a good route? Thank you.
1828,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,simple answer: Bootcamp. I speak from experience. I have only  6 credits left to finish my MS Computer Science degree and I can tell you right from the bat.......I learn more about tools that I will actually use on the job market from youtube not from my masters classes. Bootcamp is more hands on. You learn by working on projects not reading some text book and doing a quiz (The answers to the quizzes are on quizlet anyways)

1842,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Very informative. I recently became interested in data science, and I'm trying to find out what my best course of action would be. My biggest issue is that I don't have any computer science exposure. I was a biology/pre-med major, and I've been working in the pharmaceutical field for 4 years. I have a decent grip on statistical methods, but again no knowledge of coding outside of excel and a few lines in R.

Right now, I'm finishing my sophomore year and my first internship, but I'm finding it increasingly hard to even get a response from data science-related roles. I'm worried that this will be a snapshot of what's to come even when I graduate, do you think a Master will help with getting past the initial resume screening, or is it not worth it if it's not from a more recognized school? Also, really appreciate the fact you are still taking time to answer questions on old videos!"
1845,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Master's in astrophysics here! I'm planning to complete two Coursera certificates in Deep Learning (by Andrew Ng) and Data Science (IBM). I have also taken courses in databases and data mining as part of my master's. Hopefully I can get some job responses soon.
1846,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi,

I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I've been out of college for about 2.5 years now and have recently made the decision to switch to Data Science. I have a decent level of programming experience from my time in college/work with Matlab and C++.

And I'm trying to figure out what the best path to this would be for me? I'm not really in a position to stop working, but my company will pay for me to go back to school up to 10k per year for graduate programs or 5k per year for certifications. Over the past month I've been utilizing as many online free resources to learn as possible including kaggle, LinkedIn learning, etc.

What would you recommend is the best move for someone in my position? Do you think after I build a few projects I could start applying to entry level Data analyst positions?"
1847,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Very intuitive. Thanks. I've a Master degree in Physics (specialization: particle physics). I'm thinking of diving into data science.

A master degree could be a great choice if I want to move to a data scientist type of role. I wonder if you could share your thought a little bit about  a master in DS vs Stats. My concern is DS programs are relatively new, and maybe most hiring managers are suspicious about the program and expectation of candidates are not established yet, so they would rather choose candidates with stats background. And plus, fundamental knowledge of stat could potential help solving hard core tasks in career later. Could you please share your thought on this please? Thanks!"
1854,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,I'll be going to General Assembly for Data Science in July.  I'm currently working on my math and Python skills as I don't have a professional Analytics background (coming from Sales).  I'm really grateful for your insights as to how to make something out of my own circumstance!
1855,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Yes but can a data science certificate get you a job as a data analyst? I would imagine that it could, and then that could be leveraged to get into a data science/data engineering role."
1856,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hello ken! New subscriber here.
My current situation is that i've graduated with a Honours in Biochemistry and last year i enrolled into another undergraduate degree in Computer Science because I figured I would switch my career in hopes of finding a job. After completing my 1.5 years, I've decided to take on a Data science course on udemy and has since created 3 personal data science projects. Do you think that's good enough and that I should apply for jobs or should I just finish my Comp sci undergrad. 


Also loving the content you put out!


Thanks"
1857,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hello sir , I'm currently enrolled in computer engineering in university and there are some of the courses (which are basic for datascience)  in my syllabus and i'm willing to get more of data science but I'm confused ? What can I do for it ? Will I take free courses or join bootcamp or get online certificate?"
1858,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"I'm in Ireland so the set up is a little different but my original degree was in social science and now I'm doing a higher diploma in Data Science.  This is a post grad qualification that is an add on to your degree but it's not quite a masters either.  Personally I'm coinciding that with different online courses or certificates.  The diploma is  two years part time and it is designed for people with no data science background so there is a lot to cram in. Naturally there will be area's that i'm weaker in or where the diploma does not go into detail as I would like so I use certificates  to fill those gaps.  Mid term term breaks, winter breaks and soon summer breaks are a good time to do these when lectures are no longer running and you've finished up exams.  In saying that university education in Ireland is  a lot cheaper.  My first degree was free and this higher diploma is around 4000 euro in total so I don't mind spending an extra little bit to do some courses in my own time."
1859,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hey Ken, thanks for the video. I have a question I hope you could help me answer. I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree, and I would love to transition to the field of Data Science. I am planning to do that by enrolling into the Masters Program. Another reason why I want to get the Masters is because I am planning to immigrate into another country, so getting a degree there would be one of the best options for me, as I can't get a job in DS right away. During my university years, I've been introduced to most of the basic concepts of Statistics and Calculus. I've completed a few DS courses online together with some CS and Programming Extension courses. My question is, do you think getting a Masters degree in Data Science is suitable for me, and what are the chances of me getting accepted into the program? Thank you very much!"
1860,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,I like it!
1861,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, i have a PhD in mechanical(thermal modeling), with 15 years of R&D design, investigation and project management experience. i have finish data science core from Edx with a certificate. it includes intro to python, SQL and essential maths in python. i am currently doing anther certification with 365 data science, it has 23 modules. I had done coding, mathematical modeling, and matlab script simulation during the working years. i had done a lot of maths in high school, especially the whole of statistics. i am currently thinking of doing a bootcamp in my country, which originally cost USD 20k, but able to get a discount down to USD 5k. its is a twelve week course, and i plan to take 2 months leave for the course. i agree with you about the networking the bootcamp can offer and also skeptical that all the online certificates can land me a data scientist job. what do you think? thanks in advance. great vedios that you had uploaded. i learnt a lot."

In my engineering, I have learned almost mathematics you have mentioned one of your video."
1870,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"I'm doing economics and statistics degree and I'm already self taught software developer. I'm good at Python too. 
My question is, if I teach myself data science,is the this econ stat degree going to help me in the job requirements or they just need data science cert?
And is it possible the math  taught in my class ( Calculus1 &2,statistics and linear algebra)  may cover for the maths required for data science or I need to learn more maths?

1873,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,Thank you so much for putting this content out.  It's an invaluable resource for someone like myself who is in the process of applying to grad school.  I was wondering if you think the pros and cons of a masters degree outlined in the video would apply to a masters in statistics as well?  I'm currently working in a completely unrelated field and I'm applying to mostly stats programs but a few data science as well.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
1874,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hi Ken, thanks for another insightful video! I have my BA in applied mathematics, and have been studying programming and machine learning in python for 6+ months now. I prefer self studying over schooling because I feel  like I learn best that way. One problem I'm currently facing is that a lot of entry level and internship level Data Science/Analyst job postings require either a PHD or a Masters degree. Should I keep putting my focus on my coding projects for my online profile for employers to see?"
1875,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"Hello Ken, I love your videos. I have a question.
How I can know if I am ready for applying to internships or not? I have done few online courses on data science and worked on some projects during the course but still I have low confidence which always stops me from applying to internships."
1876,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,great insight !
1877,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,"As an undergraduate data science major, I've worried about not being able to land a data science position immediately after graduation. A lot of companies still seem to require a masters degree or at least 2-5+ yrs of experience for data science roles. I wanna carefully anticipate that these requirements would change within a couple of years to where undergraduate students are welcomed to apply, as I believe data science field is growing rapidly!"

1884,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"Still valid approach in September of 2021.
One mistake that most of the beginner do is to that they try to master stuff in one go but forget to consider that you can't master programming(python in our case) by watching tutorials after tutorials in one go. Rather  to work on your building projects. In this way you will go through trial and error and will learn alot."

I have been learning data science for the last year. and I have one problem which I often face and can't find the answer to. which learning an algorithm, we get the logic behind it. we learn the intuition behind the algorithm. but while doing a project, and actually applying those algorithms, we see a lot of parameters, literally 20-50 parameters. and I personally don't get the intuition behind all those parameters. looking at those parameters makes it more complex. when I search on the internet, it says that ""usually we use this value for this parameters "". but can't find the reason. 
Also, while learning deep learning, it's too difficult to find an answer to my doubt. 
I hope you got what my problem is... let me know your view on it.

1964,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"I am enjoying your funny clips in between the serious talks. Also, I resonate with using multiple resources to understand a particular topic. Earlier, I used to give up on a certain topic if I didn't understand it in the first go. Now, I take breaks and go back to it using multiple resources. As usual thanks for your awesome advice and your videos are getting more and more entertaining."

1967,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"Last year, I worked on a data science certificate. I learned a lot. However, the program didn't talk about portfolios or branding. It's funny because the training was funded for underemployed individuals..to help them transition to a new career. ALSO, it had 0 programming. I happen to know coding, but I've done no programming projects in this program. 
My first step for 2021 is to learn if I can actually be attractive to employers with this learning (Tableau, RapidMiner, KNIME, Alteryx) and to find a source of temporary income, while I figure this out."

Can I ask you just one thing: In your opinion is better to improve machine learning knowledge first and after move on deep learning, or study them together?"
1972,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"Thanks for the encouragement Ken Jee — great channel. 

Last year, I took your advice and have been learning data science pragmatically mainly through projects/challenges in Kaggle. 
I’m also enrolling in UT Austin’s new MS program starting this year. Looking forward to the continual learning process!"

1980,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"Hi Ken. I just opened up my course work for my master's program in Data Science from the University of Denver and I am on red alert! The bridge math courses are so intense that I feel like I may be in over my head. The calculus bridge course essentially covers calculus from limits all the way up to multivariate calculus and beyond (4 to 5 calculus courses) in a span of 10 weeks! Their discrete math and linear algebra combine these two disciplines as well. I may switch to Eastern University's program which is much less math intensive and can be completed in 10 months. Do you think companies will really care where I get my degree from? I enjoy math, but not at such a pace that I will have difficulty retaining any of it. The fact that I end up spending over 95% of my time using outside resources to even begin to understand how to do the homework assignments leads me to believe this may not be a very well structured program and that I might as well drop this master's program and switch to a different one."
1981,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"I'm interested in shifting my career to ""Data Science"" & I need an advice from an expert in the field after watching good amount of your Youtube videos.


I moved to Illinois, Chicago 7 months ago from Jordan. I've been in the Marketing field for over 5 years & I decided this isn't the field that I wish to continue perusing.

Since a lot of companies require Master's degree as a minimum requirement for a Data Scientist position. I conducted MSc programs search that would have low entry requirements considering that I come from Business major, and  I came across ""Eastern University"" Data Science Accelerated (7 Weeks) Online MSc, which I applied to & waiting a response from the admission office.

I compared the curriculum to other universities, & I noticed that Cloud Computing & Algorithms are not covered.

My Question:
If I proceed with this low entry barrier University (If Accepted) considering my lack of technical knowledge coming from a Business Major (Learning Python & SQL on my own)
- Will I be able to land a job after finishing the program? since the university isn't well recognized or hiring relies on sharpened skills?
- Does the curriculum cover the needed practical knowledge on the job?
- What are the areas/topics that you see important and are not listed in the curriculum?

Below are the information of the program, if you could spare 15 minutes of your time to give me a candid opinion.

1983,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"""So the first thing that I'd change... would be to start with a plan this time.""

... Yup. :/

I need to finish refining my powerlifting EDA project in Python, then use the same dataset for Tableau visualizations. I may go back to the Python project after that to add a regression model or something.

Definitely need to flesh out the plan by the end of the week though. I feel I've made noticeable progress but not as much as I could've made with more planning."

1987,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"well, what's the difference between data scientist and machine learning engineer or researcher?"
1988,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"Hello Ken, I have a MSc in statistics and would like to move into data science. I recently did a 3 months bootcamp in data science in Paris but the courses were not very good and were not enough in-depthed. I am thinking about doing a master in that field. What do you think would be better suited for me, to do a master in data science, computer science with AI specialization or a master in artificial intelligence? I will probably do it online and I don't want to make any mistake in the master I will choose given the financial cost. 
Thanks for your help."

1996,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"Hello Ken, this isn’t really related to this video but I was wondering how much your college GPA matters to getting your first data science job or internship? Could having done your own projects or having a good amount of work experience help offset a lower GPA? I would love some input from a person who is actually in the field."
1997,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"I started my journey in this world this year with a six-month paid course and although I'm very happy with my initial progression, I'm also a bit nervous about the amount of new information I'll have to learn. But seeing your videos help me to calm down and give me more motivation to continue this journey. So thank you Ken!  Greetings from Argentina!"
1998,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),I find the third point extremely helpful: rewriting codes and taking notes of lines you don't understand yet.

I've been learning Python for DS for 6 months now using Youtube tutorials and most recently DataCamp. I already have good statistics background and will be taking soon a nice statistics course on Udacity. I think it is a good moment to get my hands dirty with projects, but I've had a hard time finding some. Where do I get DS projects for beginners?"
2009,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),Hi Ken! I just noticed that the annual subscription to 365datascience with 47% off require a promotional code or the link is not working properly. Do you have that code?

2014,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"Took me a while to write the comment, sorry. I've been busy with Christmas preparations (sending virtual Polish Christmas pierogi to Hawaii ;) ). 

My new year's resolutions are a bit similar - I want to get more engaged in communities and find new friends. Also - maybe eventually appear on your YT Channel as a successful transition to DS story ;) 

I have many ideas for DS projects, but they all need some more research (some including IP & compliance research - hey, I used to work as something like a ISO/FDA compliance officer for a while, I kinda like this stuff? I certainly don't mind it... I found some courses on Coursera about those topics... I am not ruling out taking those courses in 2021. Engineers that are willing to get involved with those topics are rare, so familiarity with such issues can be very valuable to employer... it is just an idea at this point, no decisions have been made). 

I also need to take some deep dive on deep learning and some machine learning algorithms. I ABSOLUTELY need to browse & learn from other people's DS projects more. It's very inspiring too ;)

I am looking forward to the new 66 Days of Data (why 66? why not 69? ;) or any other number?)"
2015,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),1) Start with a plan. That's what I need to do now. I've been jumping around too much. I was interviewing for a couple of months with one company and had a few coding tests that inspired me to focus on those subjects. Then I got the form letter of doom. Now I need to look at what I want to do and refocus. Thanks for the inspiration and the motivation.

The previous modelling performance was only slightly better than the benchmark and then I started all over and found a few things missing from my previous work (combine the datasets first, check the types of missingness, deep understanding of each variable, etc.). So far I made three sharing notebooks(EDA, missingness, fare analysis).  Through this project, I became more aware of the importance of EDA and feature engineering."
2018,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"Actually I don’t understand the #66days of data, do we share our progression like everyday but each one on his own or what? If there’s a video like describing it more then can anyone refer it to me.
Also, I really like how you talk about overcoming the comfort zone or the fear of digging into projects cause yeah it’s very true."

I really have been absorbing and enjoying your videos for the past 3 months. Having a physics background and a secret fear of programming, your clear philosophical approach has been a lifesaver. 
I thoroughly enjoy the weekly interviews on KNN and the separate, visual content your youtube channel has to offer. It's so cool to track your growth!

I have a masters in applied physics and am currently trying to land my first full-time data science gig, so I will be sure to add regression & classification projects to my github (Only have Monte Carlo & Clustering projects right now)

Can't wait to see where your punny dad jokes go next!"

2040,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),I appreciated your video Ken! 2020 was a challenging year for me in terms of defining what to study and you helped me a lot on this! I am looking forward to starting the path I idealized and being part of your community!
2041,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"Great advice and content Ken! One thing I would love to add to those seeking their first job is to ignore job titles, and be open to positions such as ""BI Analyst/Engineer, Data Analyst, etc"", especially if you are entry level for several reasons  1) I was a BI associate and had opportunities to work on ML. Companies use terms interchangeably, and I have seen ""data scientists"" who do SQL and reporting all day.. 2)  If you want to be a data scientist, you'll have to work with analysts, BI people, data engineers, and stepping into their shoes will help you in the long run. In a way it's taking 1 step back to take 3 forward.  and 3) People should really focus on bringing value to an organization, rather than just doing ""cool"" projects. A lot of companies aren't ready for advanced ML/AI. You will be more miserable creating a data science project which will never be put into production than creating a Tableau Dashboard that the whole business will use.  Here’s to a great 2021!"

2045,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),Thank you Ken. I'm really enjoying your videos and podcast as I begin my data science journey.
2046,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"I basically never comment on videos on youtube, but I feel like I should do this now as I kinda like what I see and hear. The information seems to be very useful,  thank you.

I am a complete beginner, I started to learn data science a couple of months ago, 5 minutes ago I finished to review some EDA (it is a part of my course). At this moment everything seems to be so complex, I feel like I learn things really slow and I will never be good at this stuff, I hope I am wrong :)

You asked about projects, in the future I'd like to make some prediction model for an esport game like Dota 2, CS:GO or so, if I make some of this in 2021 I'll be sooo happy :D

p.s. pardon me my English, it's not my native language"
2047,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"I think a cool project I want to work on in 2021 is simulating a monopoly game. A favorite subject of mine is stochastic processes, and really, monopoly is just a giant markov chain/transition matrix. I think it'd be cool to do something like that. Still working on my main school project now which has caused a few others to be put on the back burner, but hopefully this one wraps up soon so I can focus on the others more.

2065,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"you said and i agree :first start with learn programming
at what point do u stop and say ok i ''''know''''' programming ?
so for me i decided that when i am able to solve 6 kyu question on codewars and easy questions on leetcode without any problem and only then can i say without feeling that i lie that kind of know enough python to go on
granted it takes a lot of time and pain but im pretty sure it will be worth it because then i can be sure that comes hell or high water i will never have a problem that is caused bcoz of insufficient knowledge in programming 
anybody here share my viewpoint?
am i too much?to little?"
2066,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),Love it. Thanks 🤩!!!
2067,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"Great video Ken! For 2021 I was thinking of a project that predicts the value of magic: the gathering cards on the secondary market. I'll try to combine sentiment analysis (taken from twitter) and data from online tournaments to do so. It's a greedy project, but I can use it if it works so it's a win/win haha"
2068,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"This is perfect timing. I'm just about to finish my master in physics and decided I'd like to transition into the data science field.
I've been watching tons of your videos the last few weeks, and they helped me a lot to make the decision to become a data scientist and how to start the journey!

Thanks!"
2069,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"Ken since you emphasize learning programming, use the term library not package. Yes, a nitpick but we should not be using cutesy terms when talking about programming and the vast collections of ready-built functions/methods. Your videos are always informative."
2070,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"I understand programming (Full Stack web Development), but for Data Science is it worth getting a Masters or should I learn this skill by my self?  I don’t have a STEM degree, but a BA in psych"
2071,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),Yeah Ken! Well done! Hope all is well with you and happy holidays!
2072,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"I think we all would agree that we like hearing you speak, all advices packed with practical, wholesome  and nutritious food for thought. Do I smell an early sign of another viral video, great video Ken! 😆
Some of the projects that I look forward to in 2021 is to look into transformers and its application in computational drug discovery, would be awesome to reverse engineer and decode those molecular descriptors to new compounds."

2084,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),I LOVE YOU KENNN!!! I started  my project on Titanic data set on kaggle. Your example on it is saving my time in the research stuff. I'm a beginner And I hope to meet you somedayyy
2085,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"There is so much free and good source out there about data science and so many ways to learn it... As someone just starting their data science journey and someone who is struggling with ADHD I was so overwhelmed and confused. If anyone is in my situation I've found ""Siraj Raval - Learn Data Science in 3 Months"" video helpful. You are not going to be a data scientist in 3 months obviously, but I think it is giving you a rough plan. It is divided into weeks and each month you do one project. Of course, I also check the resources Ken suggested and I am following a Python course on Udemy, so it is ok to mix all of the advice you see. One more advice:  you can better learn a subject when you teach it. So I recommend you start a blog about your DS journey. You can take 10 mins each day and write about what you learned that day. It is also good for you to see how much you've learned over time :) Good luck everyone!"
2086,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"You're just the best!
I started the 66 data journey with you but wasn't able to keep up, but you always motivate me, hope to be more sincere this time.
A structured curriculum should be made, at least for me to be more, you know,  sincere.
Maybe starting with Kaggle and online courses..
So many different courses, competition, everything gets me so overwhelmed, maybe because I just look through it instead of starting, but not this time, I will make use of time!
Listening to you today, made my day!
Thanks, KJ
Merry Christmas!"

2091,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2021 (What Has Changed?),"My first project for 2021, which I plan to complete during the 66 days:

I think the Marine Corps is stratifying its officer corps through selection of all schools and command opportunities through selection boards, or panels. I believe these boards are subject to heavy confirmation bias and anchoring. 
I'm going to analyze the recidivism rate of the boards, using SQL joins (which i know how to do, sort of...) and web scraping, which i don't know at all. Planning to learn enough of that over Christmas to get the job done."

I feel the urge to jump ahead but I am committing to finishing the machine learning course from google because I know I need more of a foundation. Should not take long, I plan on starting my first project this week. 

I think it would be cool for me to do a sort of reaction/breakdown of this video and how it relates to my journey for a more in the dirt perspective if that's ok with you. (not that your perspective isn't good, just that I don't need to start over because I have barely even started, I think you know what I mean haha)"

2116,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Hi, I'm relatively new to the data sciences field. I conducted a social experiment and survey for my class to determine the level of susceptibility to disinformation, controlling for both weekly online hours and strength in political party affiliations. The results were interesting, but I wanted to improve on the experiment by:
1. increasing the number of participants
2. improving the set of questions
3. collecting which sites had the most activity for each participant on a given week. 

This would be considered a regression problem, yes? Since I am attempting to predict performance based on consistent behavior. What programs would be considered ideal to collect this type of data for my analysis?"
2117,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),Really great video! Just what I needed. Thanks 👍

2141,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Thank you, Data Professor."
2142,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"The iris dataset is ideally suited for regression, classification, and clustering projects for beginners. Working with a single dataset and learning which types of machine learning algorithms are possible and appropriate can reduce the time before you can tackle resume-worthy projects. Another useful skills is the ability to compare approaches (regression vs. classification vs. clustering) so you are ready to make recommendations to your manager or client or even your team about why a certain approach or algorithm is better-suited to the task at hand."
2143,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"I am a beginner as a data analyst and looking for projects to practise with, I didn't learn ML yet so if any projects I can practise for my situation would be great.
and if I used the data given in titanic project and build some prediction but without using ML, would that be right?"
2144,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),Can we apply linear regression on titanic project?

2146,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),thanx. There is 1 funny thing: your screen backround is so inperfect ...It was  annoying me during the whole viedeo. Put that ball in that damn hole! :))))))
2147,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Before delving into machine learning I recommend aspiring data scientists hone data cleaning and exploratory data analysis skills. Data familiarization and cleaning being foundational skills. There are smallish datasets that are appropriate for beginners and which can be visually scanned to confirm the findings reported. For example, the automobile fuel efficiency dataset available from UCI contains 'marked' missing values for some numeric data, data entry mistakes primarily in the make and/or model; not every make and model combination is present more than one year, and two fuel types are present. The data source makes available the original dataset as well as a subset still requiring further cleaning, along with a codebook describing the data and each variable. Many instructors tell you to begin by plotting the data but this approach has two problems: you do not know if there are any missing values or other incorrect values which can lead to plots which are erroneous or simply cannot be rendered; and you have not spent sufficient time understanding the raw data and the types of questions it might be able to answer."
2148,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),Do you think smaller projects like these could be fine for an internship resume's?
2149,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Awesome video man!!!
Also, I wanted to ask if you could talk about how you would approach building a model for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) bcoz no matter how hard I try I don't understand how to go about it."

2160,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"I struggle with things that take a long time. If I spend several years to become a master, what will I I actually have in the end? I will be able to predict some things. I guess the hardest thing for me to think about is that 5 years will be gone and will it be worth it. Maybe by then AI will do everything automatically. Like trying to program an operating system with assembly language or something."

2171,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Hi Ken, thanks a lot for these informative videos.. For a beginner, to whom this video is intended, how many weeks would it take to complete these 3 preliminary projects? Lets say, if one were to devote a couple of hours every day to work on these ( 2 hours is an guesstimate because at this preliminary stage, most learners are balancing full time job or education ).. I ask this, because I want to follow the path but not have unrealistic expectations and beat myself.. at the same time, I would like to know what a reasonable timeframe for completion would be.."

Data are my daily bread, so I would like to manage data in a deep way and creating new value by doing it.  I agree that the best way for learning Data Science is by doing projects, so do you think that the best could be finding projects for ""beginners"" on Kaggle or it could be better to do Kaggle projects without any kind of ""limit"" (so in this case just with the purpose of increasing skills by doing different kind of data analysis)?  Thank you again Ken and have a great day :)"

2193,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"I think the point you make around 6:30 is a really good one in general for all forms of science and engineering. It's really about practice at the end of the day. We're not born math geniuses, we learn math through repetition and problem-solving. Same thing applies to data science and programming. The more you practice it, the better you get and little by little the overwhelming problems seem a little less... overwhelming :)"

2202,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"I'm trying to decide if this field is for me. I use Sales Force at work and  occasionally have to pull raw data from it. I use rudimentary search words or phrases to try to isolate cases our front line agents log from their customer contacts.

Often, however, there are limits to the results I get and almost always the data I get is so poorly captured that it inevitably means I have to manually read hundreds of thousands of records individually to see if there are trends. The categorization of the data is a separate challenge of its own.

We have folks who created a system that does this automatically, however, it's still high level information the way the issues get bucketed. It's also about 2-3 days behind so trying to get data real time is another limit.

I'm new to this, so I envision being to run raw data up to hour and be able to paint the picture of what's driving call volume, trends, for example, that we may need to act on immediately and then having technology/automation do the grunt work to classify the data and give me actionable information to present to my team and leadership. But as I see it, there's the obstacle of getting good data from the agents as the major issue in its own.  Is this even possible? Has anyone else run into this?

I was planning to take an IBM data science course on EdX. It's good to know about Kaggle. I'll check them out. Thanks for this presentation, good stuff."
2203,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),This is really helpful. Thank you Ken

2218,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"In Kaggle, I hope the projects are solved. I mean the codes are readily available to check, so going through the code snippets and understanding it makes the right strategy Ken? or should we choose a fresh project??"
2219,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Your video seems so insightful and makes me feel so much better. I am just starting new PhD program in brain fmri analysis and am reading many articles in relation to machine learning algorithms. Do you think it would be worthy spending  much time on the mathematical derivative of algorithms, or rather like you said trying to know the use and some constraints of those ? I am puzzled about this question since the derivations are too complex to understand sometimes."
2220,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),Omg he speaks so dam bored
2221,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),FyI I think the idea of kaggle itself has grown pointless when teams with big compute capacity and pretty much educational institutions have thrown the completion out of skew..
2222,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),Thank you so much! I cannot believe I didn't realize how helpful Kaggle is
2223,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),Thank you so much! :)
2224,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),Wait so if you want to get into data analysis of sports (or anywhere) you have to do computer science? Or you just need to know how to use Python/R to code for all the data entries?
2225,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),Can these projects be done in R? Or is python recommended?
2226,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Good luck with your channel.
I'm trying to learn data science by myself and Ive been told I'm a quick learner but then I know that I lose interest or motivation even more quickly and have been at this for quite some time without much progress.
I think I should go with the projects and learn alongside, hope it works."
2227,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),Mind-blowing the way to learn data science that  u have given.  Thanks a lot 😊 more video  that ll be helpful for us
2228,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Ken, been watching your videos for a few weeks. Really enjoyed the content you put out here. 

As someone who has gone through the whole switching from non-tech major to data scientist/data analyst, where is the best platform to learn all the basic beside Kaggle? Would Dataquest/Datacamp be a good source?

You mentioned project-based learning is the best way to learn data science, besides looking at the project you mentioned above, anywhere else I can start getting my hands dirty?"
2229,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),I must add that your teaching Algorithm is 95% accurate..... I would have written 100% but that will make your model ( your teaching )  over fit...you know what I mean...
2230,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"I really like the way you open up this learning techniques, I'm new in this field and please would you be my mentor?"
2231,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"I work in refugee protection and I am trying to gain skills in this field to apply it to predicting refugee status determination or other general human geography issues such as modeling human  movements internally  within countries based on unrest or disaster (IDPs) or cross-border movement.

The  UNHCR has datasets available publicly in the form of csv files.  How can I start to work with these in a Jupyter notebook? Does this need to be done from the terminal on Mac or can I do it inside Kaggle. I'm very new  to all of this and just want to play around with this data relevant to my field."

2234,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),Can i start doing the project without completing any of the micro courses on kaggle? or should i start wth the micro courses first before start doing the beginner's project?
2235,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"""Experiential learning is the best way to learn and go through Data Science"", very truly said because that helps us to evaluate where we lack and hence one is able to extend their domain of knowledge. Time to put the pedal to the metal!"
2236,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Thank you for your suggestions. I've done the Titanic project guided by the step by step instructions. I am not familiar with the Python libraries. I'm not clear on what it all meant.

Now I am working through the ML mini course. I might go back to the Python course to refresh my memory about the basics. Then I'll try the Home Prices regression. 

Question: When you say 'google' the algorithm, do you mean to search for a conceptual understanding of what the algorithms do?"
2237,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),This man is the chad of the data science community.
2238,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Hi, Ken. Can you make a vlog about your hardware setup? Great content, btw. Keep it up!"

Thank you."
2240,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"First of all thank you very much for the amazing videos to help and motivate us beginners.

Now I have 2 questions that might sound stupid lol.

1. I am currently starting with the housing project and I didn't know how to start on my own so Im using 2 other notebooks as references and kind of copy pasting, would you consider that  normal when starting or is it bad ?(I'm gonna reference links to both of them when I finish my work of course)

2. For the getting started projects in Kaggle in general and the ones you mentioned in this video when do you think I can say I succeeded with this project like what's the minimus end goal in the score or something like that ?

Again thanks!"
2241,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"I am a beginner. I have just finished a degree in Mathematics (with a focus in analysis and statistics). I'm using HackerRank to develop my python skills, I use kaggle for datasets (I perform statistical learning techniques using R) and I am using Elements of Statistical Learning to learn the mathematics (this is important to me as a mathematician) and the algorithms needed in ""data-science"" through the exercises in the textbook. I have been thinking recently that I would like to get a textbook on the probability used in statistics, such as a textbook in probability theory (and random processes), is this something you would recommend? Also, are there any ""machine learning"" or other textbooks in statistics you would recommend? Many thanks."
2242,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Hi Ken, I've been watching your videos and really have enjoyed them. I am currently doing an internship in a startup that's developing insect farms  (insects for human consumption, mostly crickets). I'm majoring in Industrial Engineering, started my internship in more of a production stand point, but due to the pandemic I've redefined the project for a data driven improvement. In the last couple of months I've helped the company with its data collection and aggregation methodologies and tools.

I just finished a basic python presential course and I'm currently enrolled in a presential course to get a basic data science diploma. a

I have no programming foundations so I'm doing basic programing course videos in YouTube, trying to get the best foundations thru free and low cost courses since  I can't afford going to college at this moment.

Is there any basic statistics course you would recommend to give me more idea about the analytics?

I appreciate that you share your experience with us!🙂"
2270,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),You made my day Sir ! Your video is quite informative and interesting. I would ask you what would you recommend for a freshman economics student to do right now to be a competent data scientist. (I am almost done with all the basic things in R so far.)

Thank you for this insightful video. And I have subscribed to your channel."
2286,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),I too have recently started to learn the basics of data science and honest;y kaggle is one of my favorite sites to find interesting datasets to work with. I took bio as my major in high school and had dropped maths in my last year so the concepts of statistics and probability and linear algebra got me scared at first but after I spent hours completing courses in those subjects (tons of pdfs and youtube channels and online courses) I feel pretty confident in my effort and knowledge. And I cant wait to dig deeper in this fascinating field of data science!
2287,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Hey Ken, hope you are doing good. Thanks for all the videos. Enjoying it thoroughly. In learning with case studies how do I know which algorithm I should choose? 










Also, can you upload a project that starts with data collection, which has a lot of missing values in it, where more time is spent on data cleaning and pre-processing as I heard from many DataScientist that they spend the majority of their time in Data preprocessing?"
2288,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),A data scientist from my firm told me JavaScript will be very useful to learn as a data scientist. How does that come into play

2292,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),Thank you for the video! It’s always so useful to actually see some real projects that people work on. You got my thumb up
2293,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),Thanks for making this video! Would you think this is a good project that I could do with Python data libraries? Analyzing why ticket sales are very high for a specific horror film compared to the US?
2294,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),Are good programming skills required to become a data scientist? Are data scientists software engineers or  rather mathematical model builders?
2295,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Through watching your video, I realized that my school DS project, which was to compare error rates of different classification algorithms, won't count as much as the topics you mentioned... I should really work more on new projects. As a recent undergraduate, I want to start with Titanic classification project. And House price regression project sounds fun too! Thanks for the recommendations!"
2296,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Hey Ken, enjoyed some of your videos. Really enjoy data science have a pretty good background as an IE major. Looking to improve my skills. One concern I have. I got on Kaggle for the first time and I was pretty excited to find these useable data sets to work on some of my data vis skills. Saw they were downloadable zip files and that immediately scared me, but I naively thought everyone else uses it and a quick google search brought up no safety concerns. After downloading about 3 data sets. I am pretty convinced i downloaded some malware. Got multiple warning signs from the browsers I use and then a bunch of random sites jumped up and teamviewer popped open. Immediately shut down and disconnected everything. Is this normal? Do you have any tips for safely downloading data sets etc?? Would really appreciate. Thanks"
2297,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Hello Ken, 


thanks for the videos. Ive learned a lot from you. 
Can you please make a video about Application for a Job as a Data Scientist (CV and how to structure my Github in case the company wanna have a look on it). It would be so helpful because Im quit good in Python  but still didn't found a job.

2301,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),"Thanks for this video Ken. I have a sports analytics problem for you. When the 3 point shot was first introduced in the NBA, I said start launching them. Traditionalists said, oh no, too risky, too many will ruin the game. 20+ years later 3 point shots are an integral part of any teams' strategy. OK, my question is regarding the 2 point conversion in football. My belief is that the 2 point conversion should be tried every time. Once a team gets used to it they will develop special teams just for the conversion. Plus, once fully developed, these plays could be used for any regular down inside the 5 yard line. The amount of dedicated plays could be unlimited - 2 QB's on the field, 5 running backs, non-traditional formations, etc. Not to mention how exciting the game would become. Do you have any supporting evidence that, over time, going for the 2 point conversion 100% of the time would pay off? I guess part of your problem is that you cannot measure what hasn't been tried."

2303,"Hedge Funds, Startups, and Data Science Oh my! (@DataLeap) - KNN EP. 14","Hi Ken,  Many thanks for your interesting and insightful sharing! I 'm from China, and have been following you on youtube. I worked for 3 Fortune-500 companies (European, American) in different roles (research, application, marketing) in the manufacturing industry in the past ten years. I like learning and  taking challenges.
My current challege is to redirect my career development into data science field to keep up with intelligent era. I hope to master the big-data-analysis skill and apply it to the digital transformation of manufacturing industry. I started learning machine learning and data analysis respectively 2~3 years ago, and took several on-line courses on Udacity, Coursera, DataCamp. I'm major in material science and engineering, much different from CS , mathematcs or statistics. There's so much to pick up! Everytime I feel like learning more, I soon found out much more to learn. It's quite overwhelming...
Your sharing helped me know better about the world of data science. As you advised, I'm now working on the Kaggle competition. Even though, the course I took before had several projects based on the Kaggle datasets and competition, it's my first time to participate in on my own. Besides, this week, I started uploading my work to github and Kaggle to build up my profile."

2317,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Been watching hours of your material (and Tina) because while I do know that it is not an easy field, I’ve been fascinated by it ever since I first found out about it. Data Analysis is my passion and the one thing I feel I came to the world for, and this role I feel like it’s the pinnacle of it. I will not give up."
2318,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Sir thank you so much for sharing knowledge and awareness 😁
But I AM NOT GONNA QUIT 
Even if it's difficult I will make it"
2319,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I got a data scientist job right out of college. To be far I graduated with a computer science degree with a minior in mathematics.
2320,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Cannot find the discord channel as i've heard in 2 different videos about it kindly share it.
2321,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"This video is old but Ill put my two cents, I have almost 3 years experience as a Data Scientist and even now my resume can match up perfectly to a job I know all the skills except maybe 2 or 3 because I've never done it before in my experience and I still get denied ALOT"
2322,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Link to the discord?
2323,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,You just jealous we be taking your job. Just say it as it is. 😏
2324,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I am 35 years old am I too late then?
2325,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,“It takes years…” no $h!t Sherlock. How many years? Dudes just do videos to act cute.
2326,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Why you talk about only negative things please upload positive side of data sceientist
2327,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,When did you find out you really like data science? I assume you took some general CS classes and they teach you about technicality of what you do as a data scientist? But correct me if I am wrong. I want to know if I would like data science or not but I am not sure how I can do that. I would really appreciate it a lot if you could help me.
2328,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I’m a seasoned data analyst and can say the following. The big data domain, so that’s data science (aka machine learning), data analytics and business intelligence, are tech fields, but not colourful ones. The focus is business strategy from a data-driven perspective. You do not deliver products as you will not be building or designing applications. You deliver insights, and in time this will have an impact on the business. So no fast/direct impact. Very high-level. You need to like thinking long-term about the business. So no colour, no app building, no designing. It’s all about strategy. You are not a developer; you are a strategist. So if you see yourself doing that, go for it. If you see yourself building or designing, don’t go for it and go for development/designing jobs. Now, there actually is a development type of job in the big data domain: data engineering. But that’s boring and really the data preparation work that nobody wants to do. They just prepare the data for the analysts to analyse. That’s it. I’m sorry for all the data engineers reading this, but it’s the truth and you know it. But hey, if you have a passion for that, go for it what can I say. 

So this sums it up. Good luck 👍🏻"
2329,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Hi Ken, is data science suitable for introverts?"
2330,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Thanks Ken! 
I'm a college student in my freshman year and wanted to be a data scientist too. 
Everyday I spend hours of learning code and math. Like what you've told us, it really consuming my energy and time at the point where I don't spend a lot of time with people around me. Kinda hard to find balance but I really enjoy what I'm doing and preparation for coming years. 
It also hard to find balance between data science or my college, before I came into this, I was straight A students but this semester I'm not sure because I spend too much time for learn data science. 
Btw thanks for the insights!"
2331,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Thank you so much for your content, it is super helpful! Would you say the educational barrier in this field is something that matters long-term? I completed an MA program in Social Sciences and I am continuing to improve my technical skills but I'm scared of not being taken seriously because I don't have a STEM degree."
2332,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I suppose the first challenge is the most obvious especially in a bank I work for. All dudes are at least holders of Masters in Maths or CS etc. In my current position I work within members of this team and they're all very good in DS.
2333,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Yes. I shall
2334,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Yes, I whole heartily agree with you that education is a important requirement. I would be careful in  putting ""Barrier to Entry"" and ""Education"" in the same sentence. A lack of education is a barrier to achieve one's potential. Also you need to apply what you learn and not let it perish or atrophy over time. I have copied code that I didn't fully understand and got it work. I believe that there are amatuer data scientists out there that one day could turn professional."
2335,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Can you make a video on what college courses I should take in order to get into data science
2336,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Hi Ken Jee, Thanks for sharing so much great info from a personal perspective. I just subscribed to your newsletter but can't leave a comment below a video. Why? Set that way, problem my end, or problem with set-up. So, for your video, A Quick Data Science Project Tip #shorts, I will comment here. Rather than try to make the Iris data set interesting with a good story (same for the Titanic one), why not just choose a more interesting dataset? Kaggle has ones on wine, California wildfires, Covid vaccines, the covid-19 virus, Olympic medals, and so many more. My tip is to take the time to find a compelling dataset for your class assignments / projects. It's better than trying to make up a great use for that boring  iris file. (I did look up ""sepal"" though and learned a lot from class examples.)
https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter"
2337,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I thought there was a huge demand for Data Scientists.
2338,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I was interested in this field as an entrepreneur, either way guaranteed income... but my real passion is aquaculture 
bio-engineering thus in itself is a multi disciplinary beast, interesting info"
2339,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Today I asked my professor why he's doing PhD in S. E rather then Ds and he said ds is a technique not a field but due to its popularity its a field now and its a very small part of S.E and mostly apply rules of S. E
2340,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Any JOB that's paying 100-150K is NOT that hard. I made about 100K from capital gains alone from 2020. Now, learning Data Science and taking those skills and applying them to develop and implement low-latency algorithmic trading applications -- that qualifies for this title IMO."
2341,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I'm still trying to find my own path, do you think data science is a good option or should I opt for something else?"
2342,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Man, you really have a big fixation with papayas. Hahaha! Papaya Scientist."
2343,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Clearly, I am not acquiring these skills to become a data scientist; I just enjoy knowing about these topics. Plus, I have some projects to boast during dinner chats."
2344,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Im not gonna study data science to become something else but I appreciate the reality check you are giving here
2345,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Hi, thank you for this great advice! I really wanted to become a data scientist but now I've been considering that choice for a while.. Is it possible for me to take a master degree in data science after a bachelor degree in actuarial science?"
2346,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,what is the best degree to be a data scientist
2347,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,My majoring in Data Science watching the intro👁👄👁
2348,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I will be graduating in December (Ph.D. Chemistry). I am interested in getting into Data Science. Have you got any good starting point and tips for me? I got a bit worried watching your video there 😅
2349,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I got my first data science job, and I start on 8-6-2021!"
2350,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Interestingly, the field is shifting away from “grab any bloke who can spell data science” to one where domain expertise for specific industries will get you farther up the chain. You DON’T need to be at FAANG to be successful in the field."
2351,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"From looking at your video and at the Data Scientist guy at my company, I realise the most important part of becoming a Data Scientist is the hair do."
2352,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Why should I become one or want to? I'm a physicist and see ""data science"" from a -- .... correct perspective. Thank you."
2353,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"DevOps Engineer vs Data Scientist 

Salary, jobs, difficulty, time constraint?"
2354,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I'm 30 Years old, what is your honest opinion me to become an Data scientist.?

I was thinking to give my self full 4 years to study and learn everything there is, plus as many Projects as i can gather along the way by implementing everything i learn in to participating in the projects.

I'm very much obsessed with A.I sci-fi, and i have one big startup project that i would love to build my self as an side project along the way while I'm studying too.

I have 11 years of experience in marketing, business management, had an marketing agency once did pretty good.

Could you enlighten me on this subject, would 4 years be enough to  get a job afterwards.

Currently i have all the time in the world to study.

Thank you so much.

Have a nice day. 🤜🤛🍺"
2355,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Why am I watching this and what the fook is data science xD
2356,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Just started my first full time job with the title as data scientist. Your sharing helps a lot!
2357,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I honestly came here because I just started learning about data science and was considering it as a career opportunity, and this video was great for helping me not only feel informed on how much education is needed but also that the market is SATURATED. I'm leaving a saturated job market, so that's really important to me! Thank you!!!"
2358,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,to answer your last question in this video: YES
2359,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"The contents in the video is great but unfortunately the title of it is aimless and frustrating. You know that if anyone who just decide to become a data scientist and in the beginning of their way and see the title of it then enter like i did, you made the subject very difficult on them like "" what all of these challenges i will take.. it is a long way ... No no I can't continue i am gonna give up"" just because this video??? Why don't you encourage all people to work in this field encourage, motivate them?? , but in fact it is not difficult, it just needs to work hard... 
You're already making videos related to data science, but why would you put someone down when they've found a dream and want make it comes true?? And also make him worry that he might back off and you prove that belief in his head? Also at the beginning of the video you talk about this as if it is impossible for normal people to do
Sorry, but your introduction to the challenges that will face any student or a normal person who has decided to major in data science will lead him to desperation from the beginning of the video"
2360,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Hi! Would you mind sharing how you got into data science? As in what was your path to this career and what you suggest for someone still deciding where to go to college.
2361,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Title of video made me afraid but I have grit to watch the video all the way 😁
2362,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Another Tech Lead wannabe slapping clickbait titles on videos which are just rambling about common sense issues.  Just a reminder that you shouldn’t listen to You-tubers for career advice
2363,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,do all these points apply to Machine learning as well ?
2364,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Just landed my very first job as a junior data scientist yest watching dis vid in my feed xD
2365,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"why am I watching this, I'm an English major lmao"
2366,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Signed my Data Science position in Sweden today :)
2367,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I’m watching this after landing a Data Scientist Position at my company! :)
2368,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Hey Ken! Just stumbled across your channel and totally agree with this video - I’m a data scientist across the world in australia and I’ve also just uploaded a day in the life video! would love for you to check out ☺️
2369,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"nice video, but this applies to any new job that will come up in the future. If you don't want to learn, you're lost"
2370,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I would highly suggest a masters to get your foot in the door. You’ll almost be guaranteed to get a job after you graduate
2371,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"As a software engineer, you are correct"
2372,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I don't wanna become a data scientist....I don't even have anything major common with that field

But this video still made me reconsider my options....it good that I remembered I ain't a data scientist before applying for a ...
This video was convincing 👍😁"
2373,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"In a nutshell, DS is hard to learn and put in practice because it requires a lot of passion to learn a lot of topics from different fields, and obviously there's is not a roadmap to learn all these skills.
Imagine that you are living as an architect in the earlies of the industrial revolution, then suddenly there's a boom for mechanical engineering with not structure at all to learn all the stuff. You'll have to learn by yourself physics, math, thermodynamics, etc. This is how DS is, is a new field and a lot of information to drive someone crazy."
2374,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Ignore the haters!
2375,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Wow, thanks for the video, and I'm just switching over my career now and  I'm really concerned, I feel old because I just a starter programmer and trying to learn data science from zero. And now I just don't know what to say, I guess I don't have any possible way to not continued to pursue this career. There is something amazing and special about this. Something from the core from the foundation that I want to learn, to know, and master.  The problem is that none of us are immortals. But I  will continue to persist, thanks again for sharing..."
2376,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Is becoming a data scientist worth it?
2377,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Might consider learning UX no code writing 
Front-end and back-end was just too brutal"
2378,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Awesome video,man.I've recently discovered your channel and i find it really informative and on point!!"
2379,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Honestly i don’t know what you are on about... Having worked as a Data Scientist for our government and for the 2nd largest bank of my country (Rabobank) i can say with confidence that a “data scientist” is just a data analist with some data engineering and statistics experience... Mabey not “easy” but far from impossible.

Second point i like to point out is that you should not want to work as a data scientist the rest of your life. You get paid significantly less for your work than for example working as a financial analist or data consultant/manager.. 

Your career path if you want to not get scammed (at least in my country) should be something along the line of: 
- BSc Business Informatics or Information Science
- Work 1-2 year as an IT consultant or Data Engineer
- MSc in Data Science, Econometrics or Statistics/Mathematics
- Work 1 year as a Data scientist at a decent company
- Switch jobs and work as a Financial Analist, Data Manager or IT manager. 

You get paid significantly more for basically less work.. my salary went from 3400€ to about 5200€ in 1 year. Worth it people..."
2380,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Very insightful and sad reality 
Passion is needed to shine in any field"
2381,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I love to learn and my friends say I have a thirst for knowledge. Some odd reason lol I kinda like the data cleaning aspect. Honestly I want to learn data science to align with my life purpose
2382,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Reason 1: I don't want to
2383,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I will thank you once I get job in Data science.
2384,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"""You will never become a data scientist"" .... but .... I am one."
2385,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Great video. I've been following this channel it's been a while. I'm at a tough crossroad now. 
My current field is Industrial Engineering (machinery maintenance). I want to switch to Data Science so I can make use of my academic knowledge to the full (Maths and Programming), also because I think DS is more Future Proof. I couldn't reach a firm decision yet, still hesitant. 

People who made a career shift to DS, what are your thought on this?"
2386,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Hey Ken, huge fan of your work. 

I'd like to add that ""data scientist"" is not the only job out there in the ""data field"". You could end up becoming a data engineer, data architect, data analyst, business analyst, systems analyst, software developer, cybersecurity analyst, decisions and operations analytist, etc. 

My point: you could start thinking you want to be a data scientists, but then realize your skill set and interests are better suited for any other of the areas I listed."
2387,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"This is very true.  I have gotten acceptance on this, as I am at the beginning of my journey.  Plus, I am convinced that this is going to pay off with a Fantasy Football championship.  YES!!!!   TOTAL FANTASY FOOTBALL DOMINATION!!!!   BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!?!"
2388,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,4:24 broken
2389,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"For sure at least we,ll be analyst.."
2390,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Let us decide what we can and cannot. OK?
2391,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I appreciate the resources. Very helpful. Just wondering if there’s any discount for upgrading “interview query”? Thanks 👍
2392,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Good first step Data Analyst and work up from there. Just saying
2393,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Recently finished listening to the audio book of Grit - strongly recommend this book for anyone also curious about cases demonstrating principles you can apply to measure/hone/learn about achievement via a quantitative social sciences lens.
2394,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I find it so interesting how just 4-5 years ago, all you heard was how this career was booming, when in reality its overly saturated, especially with people who have years of experience over a recent college graduate. Saying that, I say keep striving for it if you want it. Just dont think its a freebe. Grind out and good luck out there!"
2395,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I'm already a FS Data Scientist... and I didn't know it. 
Due predominantly to having to DIY everything solo. End to End...  I made the jump without even realizing I had.

Sometimes even a Donkey is just a Unicorn doing cosplay. Blood, Sweat, Tears, Passion, and if you don't have  bilateral carpal tunnel, you're not a FS Data Scientist."
2396,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I’m  learning data science and I will be the successful one 💙💙
2397,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Applied Computational mathematics major here hopefully it will be easier 🙏
2398,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Can I get your inputs on the online data science master degree from eastern university.
2399,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"and then after you became a data scientist, you will realize that after all, its just a statistics with extra software engineering skills. Too many people get stucked in a cool complex algorithm trap while the most important thing in becoming a data scientist (unless you work in a really specific field like NLP & Computer Vision), is to have a solid statistics base"
2400,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"is this the same as a data analyst, if not would you say they have the same or similar barrier to entry?"
2401,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,You're right. I might become an AI/ML engineer.
2402,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Data Science is advertised as statistics combined with big data.
This is completely FALSE.
Additional information technology training seperates a data scientist from a regular statistician.
What does this mean?
A statistician or a data analyst has skills that can be broadly applied - every company needs them.
However, a data scientist sometimes needs to work years in a company before contributing anything."
2403,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"That 3/4+ years of experience hit me really hard! 
Trust me I didn't started for Data Science just because because of high salaries or because it ""sexiest job in world""......Naaaaah.  I started because I like the methodology and the science behind it ( I love mathematics and statistics and a part of CS). 
AM I GOING TO QUIT? HELL NAAAH!!"
2404,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I’m pursuing my masters in data science and analytics this fall, focused on human centered design."
2405,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"True indeed, I have worked as a data scientist for 2 years shifted my focus from data engineering to data science and after 2.5 years took a complete U-TURN and currently settled with ML/Data engineer. One thing I enjoyed working with DS is to get a complete understanding of maths behind numerical computing library such as TensorFlow, which was quite rewarding for me. 

Although during the journey, I realized that I always want to be an engineer and moreover there is more opportunity as an Engineer rather than being a data scientist."
2406,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Currently a data scientist at a faang company, everything he said was so true, I studied and clawed my way for 5 solid years to get my current role. However it never ends I will be starting my PhD soon just to keep up... be an SDE if you want money and work life balance"
2407,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"OMG... It's getting tougher for me this month 😬😁

Just One comment by @ForrestKnight and it's a nightmare for me 😂😂 got downwards graph for April month😬😂"
2408,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I'm in so big of a dilemma. Problem 3 states that software engineering might be a better fit then I'll see youtubers regretting their majors the instant I search. Just give me the janitor job at google.
2409,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,how long time to become data scientist?
2410,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I thought it was pretty easy to get my data scientist job out of college??? This video seems unnecessarily harsh
2411,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Hey, I have a finance and accounting background, if I learn python,R and different languages and technical things related to data science, with relevant solo and open source projects, with relevant internships, can I get a good job in the field?"
2412,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Thank you, couldn't put my experience in better words"
2413,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I cannot agree enough about the point he makes where people don't understand the job. So many people want to skip over the data cleansing portion and get straight to modeling. These people tend to lack the CS skills required for data cleaning too. Data cleansing is the majority of the job and it's disappointing to see the lack of skills in this area among my peers.
2414,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Can I apply the knowledge of Data Science to Graphic Design?

Thank you beforehand bruh and i hope you enjoy your weekend"
2415,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Probably right to be honest, got very close to a Jr. data scientist position, lost in the final round—Im in the process of pivoting to data engineering instead"
2416,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Thanks for the video Ken. I've just started studying a data science certificate and am absolutely struggling. I'm just say ""grit and determination"" to myself over and over!"
2417,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,hey can i get the discord server link please
2418,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I am bad at math, can i still start learning?"
2419,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Being in software engineering for 30 years, having built tooling to do data cleaning , ingest, data management  etc there is wide breath and depth one needs to have in their tool box dependent on the size of the company your apply too, which many don’t grasp, it not all just stats and charts"
2420,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I just created Resume and currently preparing for Interview. And I don't have any degree. I don't have anything that is good related to Education to put on Resume. Everything relevant for Data Science I Learnt by myself. In few days I'll start applying. Don't know what will happen Since I don't have a degree
2421,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Bro I will do college or ibm and other micro cousres 
Or if do college which course I will do please please please please please please reply bro!!!!!!"
2422,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"For now I'm just learning pandas(data refining) and matplotlib for personal passion projects, so I dont even know if I want to be a data scientist. I am still trying to find a passion within cs and a niche that I could possibly get paid for"
2423,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"The problem with this vid, it doesn't say what type of skills needed."
2424,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Help!!
So I just completed by bachelor in statistics and we do not have masters programme in statistics in our place! I cannot leave my home for further study. What is the best subject I can choose for masters in order to become a DS ? And  yes I cannot study computer science!"
2425,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Do you actually have data showing that most people who apply to data science eventually choose another career? Or is this more a prospective warning to the swell of new applicants?
2426,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Pokémon is a great data-set. this guy
2427,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Truth = Truth, if one is willing to accept it. FYI Ken you just kicked many people in the *****."
2428,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I know it'll be really hard, I know that there are a lot of obstacles, but I'll try my best and become better every single day to reach my goal. :)"
2429,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Hey, 
Can you suggest me  what should I do to become an well trained in field of data science ?
I don't have any coding background. 
I watched lots of video related to  #Roadmaps about learning ML,DL, AI, or  any programming language. 
I started watching video of @Krishna naik and  @Tina Huang .  
what should I do first ? 
Currently I'm started learning python, along with this I need to improve my coding skills.  

As a beginner, how I improve my coding skills?
which specific Part I need to focus?
What should I do to stay motivated while studying ? 
Because I'm switching  my career from a manufacturing sector to IT sector. 



please suggest me a proper ways to achieve target in optimal time."
2430,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,4:35 funny thing... that's the solution
2431,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Hey what is the complete process of becoming the data scientist
2432,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Is it unwise for someone who studied electrical engineering to master in data science?
2433,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,why you got so many papayas?? thank you for making me understand that data science is not my cup of tea.
2434,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"""Great data sex""
Wow, I finally know the words to describe the fun week I've spent cleaning and fixing the data for one of the projects at job xD"
2435,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I’m an industrial engineer and I’ve been really interested in data science for some time, most of it because of you and your videos. You really explain everything behind it the good and the bad. I’m planning on learning and developing my skills on this field, I love this grind, learning new things all the time, it feels nice growing and evolving every month. Keep it up with your great job!"
2436,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I appreciate the thoughts ken as  its 100% truth of the current market situation and no sugar coating.
2437,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Hey Mate is it worth to study a One Year Data science master in Uk.
2438,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Well I'm paying 60k for a masters degree in it so I hope I'm not screwed.
2439,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Passion is definitely what pushed me through! Don't think there's anyway around that, if you don't have it you will burn out"
2440,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I know it is not easy to break into this field but I won't easily give up. I hope I can become a data scientist.
2441,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,this just motivated me more.
2442,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Discipline is like the holy rail.
2443,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Quick fact: Frankenstein is the scientist who created the monster.
2444,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Is this possible to become a data scientist as a business student?
2445,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Done Voting for you !!! 🙌🙌
2446,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Brutally Honest video. Brutal but Honest. Thanks Ken for showing the reality . However I will still follow this path. When I started this journey I promised myself that I will do whatever it takes.
2447,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Hi, great video! Tell me something: I have a laptop with AMD Ryzen 5 GPU. I am trying to build things that need CUDA. Is there any way to run it on a AMD GPU? Or it there any alternative that doesn't include buying a new laptop? Thanks"
2448,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Ken, are you planning to upload any youtube short videos about data science?"
2449,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I got lucky and in early since I studied stats like 15 years ago and did lots of programming projects on the side. Just sort of feel into it... These days I wouldn't aim for being a ds but instead data engineering or BI / analyst stuff. Go in through the back door
2450,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,What's the general consensus around tattoos in the data science area?
2451,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Ken, I appreciate that you don't sugarcoat things while still keeping a positive tone about breaking into data science. I'd be interested in seeing more ""Why You Probably Won't Become A..."" videos for adjacent roles like data analyst and data engineer."
2452,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I have been working a full time job and doing a data science diploma simultaneously but its really difficult. I still get stunned by the huge potential analysis have on every industry but being a biologist by my degree and clinical researcher by my job, coding sometimes really feels like an impossible task.
I fear I might not be able to succeed in this huge jump from one industry to another but I am hopeful.

1. How do I learn the syntax? I understand the logic but whenever I try doing something, I am unable to recall the correct syntax.
2. How do I overcome the fear of losing this epic jump? I love data and I am trying my level best to work on it but sometimes I just feel very low and don't feel like continuing because of my hectic schedule."
2453,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Would love to see a series of tackling struggles like,  what method to use and starting processes. Great work!"
2454,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Yo I'm a CSE student and just got a job as a back end software engineer. Fuck this guy. Whatever your dreams are you can achieve them.
2455,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Great video mate. I am currently completing a MSc in Data science (4 courses done). While I am loving the learning process and fascinated by the field, I have no current plans to have a career in Data science. I get way too caught up when working on a project (especially when debugging code) that other aspects of my life and frankly sanity, suffer. So I can't imagine doing that for a living, as I will never disconnect enough from work."
2456,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,“Data Science is the Frankentein of Computer Science with Statistics and Business knowledge”-How a quote can be funny and meaningful at the same time..haha
2457,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,It's been a tough journey for me till date.. Learnt a lot but still lot to learn.. DS is not a easy field to pursue..
2458,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,That corny wink about the email was awesome. Love the video Ken. Now I can go back to making snarky comments about it on LinkedIn...
2459,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Appreciate this Ken, I watched this to really test my mettle before embarking on my masters in data science and AI because it was on my recommended list. Safe to say I paid attention to the points you made but I didn’t feel disheartened at any point! Thanks for this video and pointing out the challenges faced, I think it’s very important to be aware of these challenges beforehand."
2460,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Hi Ken Jee
I want to ask, what do you think of CS50 Introduction to programming offered by Harvard? I am an absolute beginner, started learning python few days ago. The course offers other additional programming languages like Java, C, SQL etc. So shall I go for it? Or will there be extra unnecessary knowledge that has nothing to do with data science?"
2461,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I have no experience in anything. Graduated with a 2.5 in college. Just go admitted to grad school in data science! You could do it too!
2462,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Well, if the jobs are hard to find I might as well do a phd while I have that time I guess"
2463,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"My personal advice is to start as a Data Analyst (or Business Analyst), study on your free time and kick ass on your job. If you're open to your boss and he/she likes you, it will be much easier to make an internal transition to ds inside the company you already work for. It's not still not easy tho.. good luck!"
2464,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"So I’m studying management data analysis, would that be in data science role or data analytic?"
2465,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Watching this was such a relief. After all this time I thot it was just me still confused. Being in a Data engineering role for 5 years role still figuring out data science before plunging. 

Try try till you succeed🤞
- your new subscriber.🙏"
2466,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I am still at uni (bs comp sci) making a career pivot, and I must say I was hesitant to watch this video (scared the title would be true)…

Anyway, I watched it. Loved it. 

I still love data, and learning (even though the uni mountain seems HUGE sometimes) and you didn’t scare me off. 

I will get there. 

Keep up the good work, love the videos and the newsletter!! Oh, that blooper was gold 🤣"
2467,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"7:42 Ohhh my... I was dying laughing at this one 😂😂.  Unfortunately, because I can totally relate 😫. 
Loved this vid Ken, great perspective as usual!!"
2468,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Just a couple of comments on this excellent video:

For Challenge 4: Actually I'd said find the COMPANIES you'd like to go in order to decide what you want to learn. Try to learn as much as you can from them, and not just their recruitment process. Now, I have yet to find a data science job but I've been around in the job hunting department. There's nothing that puts off an employer more than someone in an interview knowing nothing about the company (I've been there!) ... the reverse is also true, there's nothing more compelling for a prospective employer than an canditate who not just put out the work on their skills but on knowing the company (i've been there too!). It show commitment and the right kind too!

As for the continued learning part, I've learned (duh!) that it something that you need to do constantly for a good life anyways ... no matter what job or hobby you like to do. I probably cited the following quotes a 1000 times in my entourage and probably here too but listen (possibly again):

""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act but an habit!"". You'll find out that this quote holds true not just for data science but also ... anything really in life really. 

It is also why challenge like #66daysofdata are valuable ... and not just for you professional career but, again ... for anything you want to do really. 

There is a metric tons of things to say about habit formation and, again, I still stand by the methods of stephen guise (which really work well!), but the gist of it is actually quite simple:

work on making your habit sustainable long term before trying to put in massive loads of work. if you do the latter, chances are high you'll burn out (fast!). Do the former, and your brain and body will slowly adjust and adapt to that new habit you're trying to form. 

PS: The variance is quite around the 66 mean to form a new habit. Some can take almost 215 days to form and others can take hold in as little as 12 days!!  (I've been there on both front!) 
But, as they say, your mileage may vary!! 

Safe journey and good luck everyone :o)"
2469,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Thank you for the great video as always Ken. The grit aspect towards the end really speaks to me as someone trying to enter into the field. I remembered when I first started out going into this field my first year at UC Davis, I felt a major hit of imposter syndrome. It all really started out with when I interviewed for a Data Science project for the Data Science club at UC Davis. The president at the time (who interviewed me) asked questions about my project experience, interest in sports (this was a sports analytics project that required computer vision to analyze the movements of players), last book I read, project experience, and my SAT math score. As I answered those questions, he didn't like many answers to any of them (never had projects because I just learned how to code from my Introductory Python course I took the quarter before the interview, not into sports, stupidly said the last book I read was ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" even though it was a book about Robert Kennedy (I was kind of nervous here), and I scored in the 600 range for math) and proceeded to say this, ""Look Jeffrey, I know there's way smarter people than you. Tell me, what makes you stand out?"" My response was, ""Uh... I'm willing to work,"" and he said, ""*sigh* Everyone's willing to work."" I basically failed the interview and he basically implied that this field isn't for me (to add insult to injury, I saw someone do better than me at the interview right after I finished). Not only that, some people thought that I would end up at McDonald's after I graduated. To compensate, I did side projects throughout sophomore year, got accepted into Facebook's Data Science mentorship called the Facebook Data Challenge 2020, secured a summer internship as a Data Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, got accepted into the MURPPS Research Program at UC Davis, and I'm on my way to prepare for an interview for a Bioinformatics Research Position in the Molecular and Cell Biology department at UC Davis to use machine learning models to predict the structure of DNA/RNA to determine how this can lead toward genetic diseases. I'm glad that having developed a sense of grit throughout the years has been so far useful for not only proving people wrong, but also giving me great opportunities."
2470,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I will become a data scientist for sure!! With one course on Udemy I figured out to clear up my basics and going on continued with the journey for the basics. Will learn it at any cost !! ❤️❤️
2471,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Hey, It is good to know the challenges you will face in achieving a particular thing. Thanks for that...  66daysofdata data helping me to nurture the good habit of data science learning. I will try my best to achieve my goal..."
2472,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Thank you for this video Ken Jee
2473,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"""Continued learning"" and ""Grit"". I need to continue learning about how to have the ""Continued learning"" skill set."
2474,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"LOL'ed at the goofy giggle to  ""data-sex"" at the end."
2475,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,The blooper at the end is the quality content I subscribed for.
2476,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Great advice, Ken. As someone trying to break into the field from a MS Math, I agree the entry level market is oversaturated, though a lot of candidates are unqualified. MSDS programs (which seem to dictate which skills are ""trending"") put emphasis on data viz & ML in Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn) but from what I've seen in job postings, very few data roles use these. Outside of FAANG, where ML operations are critical, most companies need analysts (SQL, Tableau) or SWEs to build pipelines. Creating Jupyter notebooks and applying scikit-learn is a very narrow, high-supply-low-demand skillset. There is a 2020 MIT article suggesting 1 in 10 companies benefited from ML efforts. 

I think it's important to learn skills that are trending once you're in the field, but until then it's better to learn skills that are in high demand (SQL, Tableau, cloud services).  This is what I'm dedicating my time to now."
2477,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"That wink was so cute. I started reading GRIT a week ago, it’s a good book."
2478,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Thanks for being sincere about this kind of journey. Lets make our best effort and never give up. Greetings from Argentina!
2479,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Data Scientist... Becoming! 🔋
2480,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Great video Ken!
I feel you, I cried two days ago trying to fit data into SVM and Adaboost.
The first worked, but the second still doesn't. Gotta keep on grinding, eh?!"
2481,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Ken between Data Science and Data Analytics wich one is more compatible with getting a remote job from another country? Keep it up man
2482,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,How can you fare as a freelance data scientist or a machine learning engineer?
2483,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"hey Ken, greetings of the day...I was wondering if you can make a video about creating a data science startup...thanks in advance"
2484,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"The odds are surely stacked against me being 46 years of age and only having worked jobs that pay minimum wage or $1 above minimum wage at most, and no related job experience. Yet, I still refuse to give up on the good life even if it means settling to be a data analyst or some other computer science job like software engineering, data engineering, DBA, etc. If I want the good life, quitting is not an option."
2485,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,We demand a bloopers only video 👀
2486,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Jokes on you, your videos made me land a spot on a good university"
2487,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I feel sad thu but still want to do it.
2488,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I think #3 is by far the most important. It's pretty easy to get sucked in because everybody else is. Maybe this is not for you though and that's okay! You're not a failure for realizing that and going after something else.
2489,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"I think consistency is the most important thing I learned this year, with channels such as yours and with challenges such as #66daysofdata and #100DaysOfCode. Specially since my college classes are not tech related, since I study political science, but I want to incorporate data science tools into political analysis, so having a schedule of 1h of learning and coding everyday is helping so much! I might not become a data scientist per se, but I really believe that with consistency and perseverance I will be able to learn the skills by the end of the year! 😁"
2490,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Don’t sugarcoat things, Ken. Just tell me I’m not smart enough."
2491,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Great video with great, useful information. Thank you."
2492,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"8:24 Wait, what? Haha, that was a hilarious blooper!"
2493,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"3:12 Yes, love for the process is definitely a good reason to become a data scientist. This reminded me of Michael Jordan’s contract including a clause on “For the love of the game” . I am with you on Grit and Persistence as well as patience as the large skill sets that would shape us to become the unique data scientist we would become takes time, care and nurture. As Rome is not built in a day, becoming a data scientist or being a data scientist can take a lifetime to attain or maintain. Thanks Ken for this thought-proving video!"
2494,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"It's can very well be a ""who you know"" industry as well. (As many are)

A friend of mine got a job as a data scientist because a company didn't really know what a data scientist is capable of, but through conversations with someone at the company,  explaining what he's learning and able to do they brought him in on a 6 month contract to test the waters.  His work resulted in the company finding inefficiencies in their supply chain that went completely unnoticed for over a decade. Needless to say they offered a full time position and expanded their data analytics/data science department."
2495,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Fight to the finish! :)
2496,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,I have graduated in civil engineering.... But I wanted to be a data scientist... I have picked up a online course from coursera powered by IBM.... & I do follow you as well so that I can get more knowledge.... One day I will be a successful data scientist... ❤️
2497,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Where do you think the ML engineering field is heading? Saturation the same ?
2498,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"New look I see💯
I think for me it time management with college and data science and Internship going on hard to handle and also take care of my personal needs etc is hard but putting in efforts also loved your point and reality check this willl help us to make some relatistc expectations and also have backup and be ready adjust a but when time comes 💯🙌"
2499,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,You are amazing and inspiring. Much love.
2500,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,06:26 was that a wink? 🤣
2501,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,Despite of all these .. and  No matter how many difficulties will come on the way...   I'll never give up on becoming data scientist.❤
2502,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"DS will probably eventually just be broken apart.  Data engineers, ML engineers, DAs, etc.  I like the tech side of it personally so I’m leaning more towards engineering and analysis.  But that’s just my preference.  It can be hard to break into “data science”. So I’d tell people to not get so hung up on the title.  When I finished my internship I had an offer for a data scientist role and a data analyst role.  The DA role played nearly twice as much and used much of the same tech.  Keep your options open."
2503,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,As an aspiring data scientist thats started out recently... that’s not the video title I wanted to see
2504,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,fresh cut ok i see youuu
2505,Why You Probably Won't Become a Data Scientist,"Thanks for watching everyone! It is an uphill battle, but I still believe that it is possible to make it as a new entrant into this profession!

2518,Sports Analytics & Streaming Data Science on Twitch (Nick Wan) - KNN EP. 08,An interesting conversation today.  It occurred to me that on job fair and recruiter sites you often don't see a separate category for 'data science.'  This is despite so many firms looking for folks with that specialty.  It tells me there is a lot of room to run in this field.  Very encouraging.
2519,Sports Analytics & Streaming Data Science on Twitch (Nick Wan) - KNN EP. 08,"Hi, Ken! Great interview!

At 49:42, you mentioned something that I found really interesting. Namely, that there might be a potential divide of data science jobs in the future. Do you happen to know any other sources (blog posts, YouTube videos etc.) that talk about that idea in more detail?"
2520,Sports Analytics & Streaming Data Science on Twitch (Nick Wan) - KNN EP. 08,"At first, I thought Twitch was only for gamers, I was wrong, it is also a great platform for data science! Truly innovative and great value Nick is bringing to the community 😃👍👍"

2524,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hey Ken! I know this is an old video, but I was watching this again to plan a project that I am planning to work on. At the exploratory analysis part, you say that age looks like it is normally distributed. However, I'm pretty sure that if we run a Shapiro-Wilk test on it, it will turn out to be non-normal. So, I am wondering what do you mean by 'looks normally distributed' here? Are you looking for extremely skewed distributions to normalize? Thanks! Go #66daysofdata =)"
2525,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Could u please tell how did you change color to black of ""Out""s ?"
2526,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Ken, I'm a long time listener first time caller :) This is a terrific video .. and I have one question!  

... at around 22:00 you clearly tell us that concatenating training and test datasets together and then pre-processing them all together is NOT the way it should be done in real -world (real world way, as I understood: train encoder scaler on training dataset then transform test dataset using encoder scaler trained (only) from training dataset). 

So .. do you have (or do you know of one) similar to this one but which demos the real world way of doing business?"
2527,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Hey Ken! I am copying this project to understand the process. I am confused about the explanation you give on using all_data vs training & test data separately. Can you explain why training and test sets should be processed separately by giving a bit more background? Thanks!
2528,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Great work!  I was just wondering why you would create dummy variables for features like ""Age"", ""SibSp"", ""Parch"". These features are either float or int. They are continuous and not categories/strings like name_title."
2529,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hi Ken, any reason for calling fit() method twice on rf? I mean best_estimator is used already. It is not the case with xgb.."
2530,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Thanks a lot!
I'm just beginning with Data Science. I 'don't understand, why you transform ""norm_Fare"" to a Dummy-Variable with 0/1?"
2531,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Great video! Do you perhaps know whether should beginner in ML have good knowledge of statistics to even start learning it, and advanced knowledge of calculus and linear algebra?"
2532,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Kenny Jee's done it again! Thanks a lot for this. Syntax is a bit unfamiliar but I appreciate the thought process walkthrough.
2533,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Thanks for sharing. From start to finish to this video, how many hours did you work on? I just want to benchmark myself accordingly."
2534,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),thanks Ken this was really helpful
2535,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Thank you for this great video! I've already subscribed to your channel, digging to find a lots of DS insights )) 
But please improve the audio quality in future videos: background noises are really frustrating, and a background music seems to be a little bit loud. 
But again, you're making a great resource that is very useful for Data Science beginners like me!"
2536,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hi Ken Jee, thanks a lot for the video! Can you please share on Feature Engineering on Cabin? What does the number 0-4 indicates? I don't get that part. Thank you!!"
2537,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"I have a question. in the preprocessing stage you use test set along with training set and you said you do it because in this case we want to know about the test set, but I don't know why. aren't we supposed to predict the output of test set? why do we need to have some information about it in our prediction model then? isn't data leakage happening here?"
2538,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),I think this explains clearly how to approach data. Helpful.
2539,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"thank you sir to make this video I can't explain it in words.
how much information in this video. which is really helpful for me to become a good data scientist. thank you so much"
2540,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hey ken I have a question I’ve spoken to you before , back when I was getting started with the google data analytics certificate I’m done with the program now and I noticed they didn’t teach us how to create models and test sets and stuff … what would you suggest I do next ? I’m guessing machine learning is an important aspect of being a data analyst .. should I take a course on that and get that out of the way ?"
2541,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Thank you Ken,
just now I finished one course that focused on Titanic survival, your attitude makes more sense for me."
2542,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hi Ken! Thank you for this and all other videos. That's very generous of you. Very valuable information.
My company is suscribed to Coursera and I was wondering which opinion you have of their Data Science courses. I have seen many of your videos, but I think you haven't named it. Is it because cost, quality?"
2543,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"I know this is random question, but to make sure I'm understanding the data, at 14:59 does the last row mean that 2 people had 5 cabins?"
2544,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),woo!
2545,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),How long does analysis and mode building like this take?
2546,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Is this a binary logit model?
2547,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),9:44
2548,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hello,

I ran this code and received no output:
import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

Input data files are available in the read-only ""../input/"" directory
For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory
import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
for filename in filenames:
print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))



Also, I received a FileNotFoundError after running the second line of code:

train_data = pd.read_csv(""/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv"")
train_data.head()

I downloaded the necessary csv files to a folder on my desktop



I would greatly appreciate any suggestions on how to proceed further."
2549,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),this level of coding is scaring me
2550,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hey Ken Jee, thank you for the video, it's helping me a lot. :) I wanted  to ask though, how did you know that you overfitted (the spoiler alert) with XGBoost?"
2551,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Very cool! By the way, you wrote ""compention"", instead of ""competition"" in your notebook's opening remarks <3"
2552,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),You did a great job explaining your approach to solving the task at hand and walking us through the process and so Im wanting to know what would be the next steps for someone wanting to use this competition to learn data science?  Like I dont have a detailed understanding of all  the algorithms that you used in this competition so  would it be best to pick the one that produced the best score and learn how to tune that particular algorithm model metrics to get a better score or would it be best to transfer your process to another beginner competition altogether to create a better understanding of the complete data science process as a whole?
2553,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Would you consider doing one for the linear regression example you suggested on your 3 beginners’ projects? It’s the Aimes housing prices project
2554,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Really awesome! My only minor criticism is that in the first half of the video, most of the pivot tables and charts are displaying counts. When comparing counts between categories (i.e. survival rate by age) it really needs to display the percentage of that grouping... Sadly I'm too much of a noob to figure it out just yet :("
2555,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Thanks Ken. I loved the video! Do you have any videos that deal in more detail with the correlation heat map output in line 9? I would love to know more about what I can learn from this and when to use it.
2556,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"hi ken jee! one question for you! about the dummy variables! for example there are 3 categories, so 3 dummy variables would be created for that column, then do we need to remove one dummy variable, because the 3 dummy variables would be linearly dependent with each other?"
2557,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Thank you for this video and your explanation how you approach data science problems. I was just able to reach the baseline from the Titanic tutorial by my own approach with XGB and GridsearchCV.

Did you tried stacked denoising autoencoder in your projects and how did it work out? It is kinda like an automatic unsupervised learning approach that can be fed into a neural network.

Your channel is golden! Keep it up and stay healthy!"
2558,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"I didn't understand almost 50% of the walkthrough,  got after EDA ☹☹😫.
This walkthrough seems to be a bit too advanced.😲"
2559,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),I have a question @24:15 after you made some changes for the entire dataset you split the data to train and test so doesn't this cause data leakage?
2560,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Thank you Ken Jee for your video. I have a question maybe you could help me with. Why did you assume/make the variables age and fair price as categorical instead of continous?
2561,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hi Ken, 

Thanks so much for your videos; I find them really encouraging and instructive.

I am wondering, how does the intuition we build about the data inform how we set up the models?
If feels like there was a bit of a disconnect there, and right now if feels like I just turn on these black box
models and get a prediction with little understanding of the variables ...

Thanks!"
2562,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),You should provide timestamps for such big video.
2563,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),overall great tutorial but fast.
2564,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Great! Very inspiring and helpful!
2565,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Just came here to see what you got. I used random forest and got .76 on my first try and then a little tuning got it to .77. I think I could make it better so I will continue to play around. I got to the point in my course curriculum mid-lecture I said ""this is more advanced than I need to get started on beginner projects"" and instantly hopped off to do titanic. I had it all worked up in my head to be some super hard task but it turned out to be relatively painless! I am going to do a couple other smaller projects and then try something of my own, probably using youtube data because I am a massive geek for the algorithim."
2566,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),You are my absolute Guide to data science. THANKYOU KEN
2567,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Thanks Ken Lee, great video. Question: i am working on a different dataset with not many features (ca 12-15). it is an imlabanced dataset with not a lot of '1' but loads of '0'. I am using TomekLinks to balance it out a bit. My highest F1 score is 5%, and whatever i do i cannot make it any higher than that. Do you think this is an example of a project where I will not be able to build a decent model?"
2568,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Since the test set has no output (Survival), should we even consider it in our EDA? Why not doing just on top of the training set?"
2569,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),What keyboard do you use?
2570,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),sir can you tell your background music?
2571,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Awesome tutorial. I have a question. Why do you log normalize Sibsp and Fare in addition to using StandardScaler? What does the log normalization accomplish that the StandardScaler doesn't?
2572,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),This video is gold!
2573,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Super informative, thanks Ken!"
2574,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Amazing video. I got a question, don't we need to detect the outlier data in the models? or its not a necessary step in calcification?"
2575,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hi Ken, Great Video.
I have a doubt though, when you say you are creating categories based on the first letter of the cabin why are you ignoring the second letter (some have different lettered cabin as the second cabin). eg -> F E69"
2576,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Interesting Project
I decided to do it with PHP

http://titanicroster.com/"
2577,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"34:18 Ken, what does the parameter initialization of weight mean. can you explain"
2578,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Thank you so much for your videos, I watch them all the time.  I'm in a masters DS program, and I feel like I'm actually on the titanic right now, going down down down.  Here you are handing me a raft, a dingy, and also giving me a map to a huge lush closeby island where there's an escape airport."
2579,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hi Ken, Great video. thanks .sorry for a very basic question but how did you get the baseline numbers? I am trying to get them but unable to do so i.e. Naive Bayes (72.6%),Logistic Regression (82.1%), Decision Tree (77.6%) etc."
2580,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),take a drink every time ken says actually.
2581,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hey, It was kind of advanced for me to do it on my own. What should I learn before doing these projects, can you share some source. Thanks for the amazing video"
2582,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),please improve audio quality
2583,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hi Ken jee, what is the process and techniques to do data mining ?? , do I need to do separate course on data mining for datascience?? I'm stuck in this phase  pls help me out this"
2584,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Hi Ken. Great video and walk-through. One question - why have you created dummy variables on the numeric features?
2585,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Hello Ken. Is there any book that will help me learn which features I should use and which features to drop.
2586,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),May i ask you which IDE you use to run python codes or for data science works.
2587,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Dude you are terrible in explaining things in a pedagogical what. Impossible to follow your quick scrolling.
2588,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Can you do more videos on EDA?
2589,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),I bet The Countess survived :V
2590,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hello there :)

I haven't watched the full video yet, but there's a reason for this and is linked to a suggestion I'd like to propose to you for similar videos in the future:

Despite being very VERY green in this, I decided to have a first go at this all by myself ... and boy was and is it still frustrating :P The reason behind this was that I wanted to try a first attempt without a guiding hand. Once I finished my first model, I quickly realized that there were tons of ways where I blundered like a total noob ... which is actually totally fine :) And despite the frustration of the experience, it felt like I gathered valuable experience from this.

And it is only now that I am starting to watch this video .. but only bit by bit, as I want to try to do as much by myself as possible (mistake be damned since they are being done at home where it won't hurt anyone and where I can learn safely from the experience).

SO my suggestion is this:
Could it be possible for future similar videos to have it in several parts? Or, at the very least, to timestamp the different section of your handling of a particular problem? I feel like it could be very valuable, especially for very recent newcomers like me. 

Anyways, thanks a ton for your videos, very much appreciated ! (especially some of the code where you use apply and lambda functions to handle data transformations, this is definitely something that will be useful for me in the near and long future! :)

Signed:
A total newbie at this."
2591,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"I gotta be honest here, started learning Data Science on my own but every now and then I become lazy AF and I just stop for a period of 2-3 weeks. It's difficult to be consistently committed to the program and learning. Although I hope I slowly complete the training."
2592,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Hi Ken....Deniz is speaking from Turkey! Your videos are helping me a lot! You force me to keep up :)

2594,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"U have a best data science chanel, I love u"
2595,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Wow what a in-depth analysis. You really put a lots of efforts into this. This is my first try in Kaggle too, after spending this much time i wonder how much time it will take for even tougher Data , i also checked the House Rent Competition. It have 81 Features. how can we do such a detailed analysis on all the features. Not sure how the real-world ML problems are solved where they might have 100 or even more features. I am really excited to know more :)"
2596,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),This video is a great help!
2597,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hello Ken, really cool video. I have a question for you. You gave us all the important variables that contributed to the model at around 32:30. I was wondering, with those variables in mind, are we able to dig a little deeper and see what the actual values were that contributed most to the model? 
If that sounds confusing, here is an example. Age is the second most significant variable in the model. If we can program what I just asked you, the model would ""spit"" out ages 15-18 years, I do not know if that's true, old were the most significant and contributed most to the model. 
This is my first data science project, so I want to apologize in advance if my words do not sound ""data sciency"" enough."
2598,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hi, Ken, when tuning the model for random forest, you use RandomizedSearchCV and then GridSearchCV. Your comment is 
""Because the total feature space is so large, I used a randomized search to narrow down the paramters for the model. I took the best model from this and did a more granular search ""
Do your mean the GridSearchCV' parameters are based on the its above RandomizedSearchCV' results?"
2599,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),The brightness is very high . I cant see the wall clocks...
2600,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"First of all Thanks Ken for this, and secondly it's a request if you can make a dedicated video on how data analysis can work in cricket, I know you may not be knowing about the game but I really want to implement some data analysis into the game of cricket, so just need your help and it will do great if you make a video on the same. Have a good day mate."
2601,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hi, Ken, what's the purpose of log norm the fare? And why we need to scale the 'Age','SibSp','Parch','norm_fare'"

2607,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Thanks Ken!
2608,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hi Ken, any tips for freshers ?"
2609,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hello really appreciate your efforts.
I'm ML beginner, done with only theory algorithms no hands on experience yet.
How should I start and from where ? Need few suggestions."
2610,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Thanks ken— never used Kaggle or even done any data science projects. The detailed analysis (including the nuances MOST IMPORTANTLY) is really making this digestible— not to mention applicable
2611,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Amazing video! I hope you do a similar video on regression and clustering problems in the future!
2612,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hey,

Please consider making a similar video with panel data!"
2615,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hi Ken, I have to predict a binary classification, the dataset has two columns with monetary information, both have right-skewed distribution. If i scale columns and /or apply log transformations, accuracy gets worse. Why could that be ? Even by removing outliers (percentile 98 or 99) it also gets worse, Thanks !"
2616,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"is regression or classification harder? I don't know which one I should start learning first. In stats, we only learned regression and never classification. Thanks"
2617,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Loving this video and the thumbnail dude!
2618,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hi Ken, thanks for the help on learning about data science. I struggle a lot using Kaggle to learn python.

2639,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Udacity or Coursera to gain valuable data science knowledge???
2640,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),Literally was looking at this today
2641,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),I am glad that I came across your channel. Always wanted to try titanic dataset on kaggle but didn't. now I m gonna try it. thanks.
2642,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),This video came at such good timing! I just taught myself python and started the titanic project today but was feeling so unsure about everything! Thank you for your videos!!
2643,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Hey Ken! Nice video :) how old were u when u started your data science career? I know it’s a weird question to ask, but still I am little curious to know as I am currently planning to shift my career into Data science field. I am 24 years old and working in Project management. Also I have a bachelors in Mechanical engineering which i think is far away from data science."
2644,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Love your videos, Ken. They are no-nonsense and stick to just DS. Your content is well made up and your voice is clear. Thanks for sharing your knowledge. I am sure with such quality content you will soon hit 100k subscribers and more."
2645,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Amazing!, i learn a lot with your videos, thanks for sharing your knowledge, hug from Argentina!"
2646,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Since you made a confession at the beginning, Imma hit you with one myself: I'm been trying to study DS consistently for a year and half and bruh... I find it incredibly frustrating. I do not feel particularly smart enough to do projects on my own but I really like your content, so I will stick around. 😬"
2647,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Thanks Ken! I'm working on the same competition and that was super helpful! Quick Q - I'm trying to build up my DS portfolio, do you think it's worth my time to do the whole thing from scratch (i.e. EDA, feature engineering, modelling) and to dwell a bit more on the theoretical stuff? Put another way, is it more important in these types of projects to show knowledge of how these models actually work, or to show that you can use tools and libraries (like sklearn) proficiently?"
2648,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),I sense a rising Kaggle Grandmaster in the future!
2649,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),"Great job! Thank you so much!

2676,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,Could I be successful majoring in Data Science and minoring in Computer Science? I recently just switched my major and minor choice because of personally preference.
2677,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,I'm a second-year Economics student. Do you think I can make the switch? I'm unclear on how to pursue data science from here.
2678,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,Awesome content 👏
2679,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"Hey, I came across your channel and I have a question.  I'm currently a junior in high school and I've been intrigued by data science for a while and want to study it in college.  As a result, I've been taking courses like AP  Computer science A ( in java),  AP Stats, and AP calc AB. But what do you suggest I should do or best prepare for an undergraduate degree in data science? 


Thank you."
2680,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,I am currently an Electrical Engineer and I always felt that my strongest side was in programming and mathematics. I always struggled with the hardware side of EE and was looking to change into another major. What are your opinions on a switch to DS? I have taken Statistics before and enjoyed the class as a tid bit.
2681,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,I still have my final semester left in undergraduate. Can I still apply for DS roles?
2682,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"Hey Ken I am currently pursuing my ms in DS but want to continue my studies further will phd be a wise option if I want to work in industry and not planning to go into academia?
 Or will MBA be a good option since DS needs some buisness knowledge?"
2683,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"i posted this comment below an other video in data science.
i saw that both you and this guy are interested in data science, so i woud like to listen also your tips.
I have a question about data science filed: do you think that a bachelor degree in statistic is more useful than a computer science degree for go into this field? in my country statistic is a sub field of social scinece and there are only few course of computer science,just databases,fundametal programming and statiscal sw. 
A computer scientist has more skills in programming,they study for example more sw exams  (sw enginners,operation system ) but less statistic,probability ecc.
I read that company prefer more computer scientist beacause they dont nedd statistician that are expert in hard modelling,math ecc but they usually ""suck"" in it field,like programming ecc.  but they need only basic knowledge of statistic and a lot of It skills.
So wht do you think, is a good investimetn a bachelor in statisitic or is better a computer science degree? there are a lot of master degree in data science from both accademical course, a lot of people with a bachelour in computer science go in to statistic and viceversa.
i would like to have your opinion about this tips.
thanks.
regard from italy :)"
2684,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,I am interested in field of x-informatics  or data driven science or computational science(which has a major chunk of data science).How would you recommend me to proceed?
2685,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,My university now offers a dual-degree in computer science and data science that has all of the computer science major courses and some statistics and data science courses. I'm not sure whether or not I should major in CS and continue into an MS in CS and take grad courses related to data science or if I should get the dual-degree in CS and DS. Is the bar for entry in the U.S. for data science/machine learning a graduate degree or could I have job prospects with an undergrad?
2686,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"Hello Ken! This is my first time watching your video. I'll be checking more videos of yours but if you don't mind could you answer me a question please? I was going to take master's degree in data science in Illinois institute of tech (IIT) from this fall semester (my bachelor is CS) but I got rejected because I didn't take prerequisites such as calculus 1-3 and linear algebra. And then I had to change my major to something related, so I chose IT management in the end because I was interested in management and MBA as well since before. But even now I still feel like compared to data science, my major doesn't seem to be that professional. So I was thinking of teaching myself some mathematics and then studying data analytics with using either R or python through free online courses. Do you think a self-taught grad student who majored in IT management would be okay to get a job as a data engineer in 2 years?"
2687,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"Sir, I want to ask you how many years will data science rule in the number 1 demand for IT profession job"
2688,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"Ken sir, I want you to add as many projects and courses in your videos as you can"
2689,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,Hey ken what would u say about self taught data scientists? Can they never become good data scientist like others? Are data scientist roles in companies can only be play by degree holders? What will employers think about that data scientist?
2690,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,Ken sir i want you to mention courses as much as you can in your videos because that will be alot helpful to us and thank you for this amazing video i really learned alot from this video
2691,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"I see a crazy hype for Data Science roles/jobs in India, is it the same abroad like in US,EU,Australia,Zealand and Canada?"
2692,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,This video could not have been timed better. I am literally meeting with my counselor next Monday to discuss switching from CS to a undergraduate DS class. Thank you!!
2693,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,What is the difference between taking an online MS data science program vs. an on-campus MS data science program?
2694,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,Ken Jee &Import data 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
2695,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"I am dual major is CS (specialising in DS), and commerce (specialising in econometrics). I am wondering if econometrics would cover enough stats for the DS field? Love the video!"
2696,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,재민 ㅡ 켄지 합방 짱!
2697,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"If someone chooses an undergraduate degree in data science, in my opinion, they should take first and second year courses in mathematics, statistics, and computer science as electives if their data science degree lacks courses in those subjects. I am currently enrolled in an undergraduate data science degree after taking over 60 credit hours in mathematics, statistics, and computer science.
This advice by Jaemin is spot on and your own videos are very useful."
2698,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"Right before the pandemic I switched over to Data Science from Agriculture. I am currently studying Computational & Data Science B.S. with a Minor in SE. 

Then I will go for a Software Engineering M.S. The undergrad degree is more modeling based... they teach R & Fortran. I am learning Python on my own, this fall I will be starting a 2-part Python certificate, 1 part intermediate 2 part advanced. I hope this is the right track? I want to learn SQL additionally."
2699,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"I am an undergraduate in Computer Science & Engineering.
Could you have a look at these Master's Programme and suggest me which is more relevant to the current industry requirements? Note : I have offers for all 3 programmes mentioned

2701,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,I’m currently doing a masters in ds with a heavy stats component. I transferred from the same course at a different institution that had one stats unit. Do you think this is a good move for my career?
2702,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"Tough call but I'd say CS or SE not particularly data science it's better to choose after you know most of the stuff that a computer student would know which you will learn in BS CS or SE, then  go for a specialized field"
2703,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"It would also be nice to here what y'all think about a Masters program in Data Science vs something more traditional like CS or Stats. (especially curious about degrees labelled ""Masters in Professional Studies"". like are employers put off by that vs an MS?)"
2704,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,Hey Ken would you recommend DePaul's MS in DS or MS in CS? I know you did CS just wondering your thoughts.
2705,Should You Major in Data Science? (Jaemin Lee) - KNN EP. 04,"Thank you for an opportunity to speak to your viewers, Ken! Hope this can help many students who want to pursue their careers in data science!"

2724,Why I Quit Data Science,I'm a 1st year students majoring in CSE(Data science) I'm really confused or have no idea to choose project. I really wanna work on some project but don't know where to begin or how to do? It'd be grateful if you could help me regarding this.
2725,Why I Quit Data Science,"Ken ı guess it is little hard to try out different roles Most of the companies looking for ""experieced in the title"" roles. Even if for example, I would be a great product owner or product manager, sisnce my title is system engineer, when HR sees that title, they say nahh, we need ""in title experience"" individual. I guess If someone can swith role, it is also ""ı guess"" chance factor is really important."
2726,Why I Quit Data Science,MBA or data science which is best???
2727,Why I Quit Data Science,"Thanks for making this video ken. I am just trying to break in, but turns out ,there's much more to life."
2728,Why I Quit Data Science,"As a person who has left a very technical role in a small fast startup to a bigger, corporate-like env, I can truly relate to you. All I do is to do project scoping for data science projects, framing the models to the business use cases, and watch vendors do the fun data science stuff. I kind of miss the hustle in the startup though. I guess life is not perfect."

2733,Why I Quit Data Science,"I'm currently learning Data Science but find it to be VERY VERY BORING. Don't know about others, but I don't know how long will I be able to continue in this.. 

Whoever's reading this, it's very appealing to enter this field but the inside story is very different. Please try some trainings a lot before entering this field."
2734,Why I Quit Data Science,"Most data scientists  arn't real scientists. Unless you have a ph.d. and do research, then you are a true data scientist."
2735,Why I Quit Data Science,Are you currently a data scientist?
2736,Why I Quit Data Science,"Haha I love the light-up dinosaur!

I'm thinking about transitioning to data science field ,and what you said about what you'd missed about data science resonated much with what I miss about engineering.
Thank you for sharing your experience and expertise!"
2737,Why I Quit Data Science,Man your intro direction is interesting
2738,Why I Quit Data Science,Stupid f**k 😀😀😀 . I like it though 🤠
2739,Why I Quit Data Science,Your thumbnail though..😭😂😂
2740,Why I Quit Data Science,Clickbait at its fullest
2741,Why I Quit Data Science,The moment I thought what's there in his glass looks like alcohol n there title popped up immediately🤣🤣
2742,Why I Quit Data Science,"Data ""science"" (more like information processing) is being pushed for a reason, it is the next step to remove more freedoms and enslave humanity, and of course they need useful idiots that can't see a palm in front of them (because they're too busy chasing the dollar) to do their dirty work. We need to fight back.

2745,Why I Quit Data Science,"Follow your passion rather than following what Sharma Uncle's son is doing or what entire world is doing. now a days every Tom ,Dick and Harry are learning data science without much insight into Statistics , in interview they are not able to tell what is formula for slope, what is discrete variable etc.  Data science is more statistician job rather that software engineer job,  ppl are learning even getting job also , but what impact they are giving to society ?  A  Data science is one who resolves the most complex problem in the world. using Maths , Science and Probability. Not a easy job at the same time not imposssible , most ppl are trying for salary , its requires more passion , focus ,discipline than any other field"
2746,Why I Quit Data Science,"What is your advice for people from engineering like me to pursue data science career?
The biggest challenge & how to manage?"
2747,Why I Quit Data Science,This guy: I quit Data Science. FOR TWO DAYS 🤦🏻‍♂️
2748,Why I Quit Data Science,If you would look in photo it is I quit green tea not I quit data scientist lol.

2750,Why I Quit Data Science,"As someone who's planning to start their second career path in Data Science, at 32, after going down the project management path... I fully sympathize with not being a personality fit for the PM role."
2751,Why I Quit Data Science,😂 Data Science.  Why would I pay idiots to do DS when it comes out of the box with automation platforms like ServiceNow.  The AI engine makes data scientists look like they did 20 years ago when Academia busted “Big Data” for being a fraudulent con game.

2785,Why I Quit Data Science,Do you need PhD for ai research?
2786,Why I Quit Data Science,I like the way you create your videos Ken. Very informative but also entertaining and just the right length. Switching up scenes is also a good touch.
2787,Why I Quit Data Science,"I started learning data science due to the hype created in the market. I forced myself to take interest cuz everyone was doing it. I watched a lot of tutorial, read blogs, made account on kaggle, read research paper on GAN, open ai and list goes on. But still somewhere all this wasn't much appealing and interesting as it was appearing before entering into it. I realized I was not very interested in statistics and probability. And these are the prerequisites to get into this field. So I tried software engineering and got into web development. Today I find it more interesting that data science and I really enjoy the process of building new project and coming up with ur own idea. Unlike data science where u have to spend hours cleaning data and training models. So I recommend everyone to give a try to every field out there, don't follow the herd mentality and explore it, read about it and then decide what's suits you and stick to it."
2788,Why I Quit Data Science,Enjoyed ur ending 😂
2789,Why I Quit Data Science,11.647 my inbox wins!!! :D :D
2790,Why I Quit Data Science,People that don't have a passion for statistics going into DS are always so shocked that they hate it.
2791,Why I Quit Data Science,can you do vlog about top 5 or 10 best data science / ml books ??
2792,Why I Quit Data Science,Yes Ken. Agreed. We need to explore our potentials rather than limiting our thoughts to just one thing
2793,Why I Quit Data Science,well if you DID quit data science you would aptly qualify for a film-making role
2794,Why I Quit Data Science,"I believe theres a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble. And finally gets us to die with pride. Even though sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing we want most, even our dreams."
2795,Why I Quit Data Science,"In my opinion Ken you're introvert and that's why job with a lot of contact with people didn't suit you well.
In big five scale in my opinion you're high in openess, low in agreableness, high in concienciousness and probably more introverted. In MBTI scale it would be INTJ type. This would explain why you don't like managing people but rather choose your own path and improve yourslelf. You also have strong analytical skills and this is your the most powerfull trait.
Hovever I can be wrong becouse my statments are based only on your videos."
2796,Why I Quit Data Science,"This videos shows  one reason y u r  attracted to  data science, storytelling is your art😉😁"
2797,Why I Quit Data Science,"Interesting, unexpected, but appreciated because part of the journey exploration is a common thought for many people. 

Love the overall portrayal as well a nice scene change."
2798,Why I Quit Data Science,Data science is like that ex who broke up with you but you still love him/her. Eventually you'll get back to it.
2799,Why I Quit Data Science,Gotta admit I laughed at that T-rex Toy
2800,Why I Quit Data Science,Was that how you discovered that would were a friggin’ PSYCHOPATH too?! XDDD
2801,Why I Quit Data Science,How can I get a data scientist job without a bachelor's degree?
2802,Why I Quit Data Science,"I knew that we have something in common. We are both extrovert.
For me: I started to study to become a full stack developer, but I really like more data science area. I love everything about computer science field, but I rather prefer analyse than build. Web and software development skills are welcome as well."
2803,Why I Quit Data Science,This was really fun.
2804,Why I Quit Data Science,Oh great. Now I'm gonna have nightmares.
2805,Why I Quit Data Science,"Well, technically he's right, it wasn't clickbait..."
2806,Why I Quit Data Science,The ending though 😁😁

Inspiring as ever, thanks ken 👍👍"
2810,Why I Quit Data Science,"Hi I have experience on data science from the last 3 years. I worked on different projects e.g: recommendation system, data mining, deep learning projects, machine learning projects and some analytical projects. But the problem is that i cannot properly find a work or a proper job. Sometimes I earn through projects but most of the time I didn't earn projects and their is no scope in our country in a field of data science. So I need your help what do I do ? Because already I have given many years to code so what to do next how do I find a proper work ? Thank you"
2811,Why I Quit Data Science,Wow! you scared me for a second!
2812,Why I Quit Data Science,"Even if you quit I'll "" stay true to the process "" as u told me once, but looking at the comments you'll never be able to quit 😂 ( unless U open a papayas' project, I'm sure everyone will understand then :3 )"
2813,Why I Quit Data Science,"I have a technical question, being a self learning , do i have to learn ETL and pipeline in order to be able to fine a job
I almost done with all the requirements you’ve mentioned earlier on your educational suggested path

Am confused 
Guide me please am really lost and I don’t have anyone but you"
2814,Why I Quit Data Science,We love you kenny!!
2815,Why I Quit Data Science,"Another amazing video ❤️
Always informative"
2816,Why I Quit Data Science,Thanks for sharing your story. I also quit doing full time Data Science after 1.5 years. I became a Tech Lead to explore more of leadership position and for career growth purposes. I am happy that I explored this option and found a way to still do Data Science within my new role after sometime.
2817,Why I Quit Data Science,"Excellent video, very nuanced and I appreciate the portion where you covered what you gained from that experience."
2818,Why I Quit Data Science,"There is always this moment in life when we are low, where we stop and think about what we do. Then take a step back to change the route or move forward with more intensity... its good you did what you wanna do coz most people scare to take a step back and loose their intensity , passion in long run."

okay everyone calm down its just green tea"
2820,Why I Quit Data Science,"well i def clicked on the video. interesting insights. idk if i would like product management or not, maybe if i could do half DS and half PM..."
2821,Why I Quit Data Science,"The business side of technical projects can definitely be a tough transition for people. 

It’s good that this video shows that people can and should explore other non-technical roles."
2822,Why I Quit Data Science,"Thanks for watching everyone! Obviously I'm back to data science now, but this was a very interesting short term career pivot for me. I hope that this video helps you to better understand what goes into making a career decision. I also hope that you enjoy my admittedly weird sense of humor, dinosaurs, and papayas.

2825,Why I Quit Data Science,Thank you for this most awesome clickbait!
2826,Why I Quit Data Science,"Man, I feel what you are saying about management and being in charge of a group of people. I did the same, moved to a management position after 5 years as a network engineer and it was awful lol, I was constantly being pressured to deliver the projects, and dealing with the different personalities in a group can be exhausting not the mention the micro-management and seeing how your inbox kept piling can definitely drive you insane. I lasted two years in that position, I quit and now I'm preparing to land a job in data science. Wish me luck xd"

2916,Scrape Twitter Data in Python with Twitterscraper Module,"Hi guys! 
So, it seems like this has stopped working, I found the fix on Github tho, 
Here's how to go about it: 
This can be fixed by modifying the header dictionary in query.py from
HEADER = {'User-Agent': random.choice(HEADERS_LIST)}
to
HEADER = {'User-Agent': random.choice(HEADERS_LIST), 'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'}
that should fix the issue.
Here's the github link: https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/296
Ken - will you kindly pin this comment for everyone's good? 
Cheers!

3000,Scrape Twitter Data in Python with Twitterscraper Module,"Hey PSA (maybe pin this or comment this yourself) but 1.2.0 as of right now doesn't really work. It's query_tweets is broken and you're going to have to specifically install 1.1.0 (pip install twitterscraper==1.1.0) in order to use it. 


Also, for anyone wondering about performance issues and harvesting tons of tweets, make use of the poolsize parameter. Poolsize controls the number of parallel scrapers you can have up at a single time. At maximum you can have one scraper per day. So for example, if you are scraping a period of 30 days, you can use poolsize=30 to get 30 parallel scrapers running at a time. If you want to harvest over a big time frame, try to harvest smaller time periods and loop through dates manually (otherwise your CPU, RAM, and internet usage will shoot through the roof). That should give you the best mix of performance and speed."

3127,Building a Deep Learning BEAST (NVIDIA TITAN RTX + RYZEN 3900X),"Hello Sir! I'm a student whose currently studying in class 12th and I've chosen the career path of a Data Scientist. Your channel is actually the first channel I've ever subscribed to, because from the first video that I saw on your channel about whether one should choose a bootcamp, a certificate or a masters' degree, I've been hooked to your channel and have seen most of your videos. First of all thank you for making them, its extremely difficult to find any person on youtube or otherwise that provides such comprehensive guides, it really helps aspiring data scientists like me a lot! Secondly I'd like to ask you whether I should aim for a CS undergraduate degree or a DS one, I've seen a plethora of videos and then I've realized that at present the CS is the go to degree, however the shift of preference from CS to DS is occurring and I'm trying to think ahead that when I graduate, would a DS degree increase my chances of getting hired or would the norm still remain CS. I'd be extremely grateful if you could provide some insight into this.
As for the name of your new beast of a machine, I'd suggest the name Kronos from Greek mythology, the Titan of Time (I'm a fan of Percy Jackson and other works of Rick Riordan). Kronos would probably be the perfect name because -
1. You said at the start your build was made around your gpu, the rtx TITAN, so for the computer to share a name with an actual Titan from mythology would be pretty cool
2. Seeing the specs I'm sure this machine will be crazy fast and that'll result in much faster response times and code compilation times, seeing that time is such an essential aspect here it makes the name Kronos even more fitting since he was the Titan of Time
3. The age of the Titans is called the Golden Age in greek mythology, seeing that your graphics card is also golden, i think it makes perfect sense

Once again thank you making these videos, they really are a huge help!
PS: I hope you like my name and the reasoning I gave"

3183,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,It's amazing that how you get ideas in your mind with picking up the projects and stuff❤️.
3184,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Short and insightful video..Great thanks
3185,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,I’m wondering how other YouTube personalities could use this leaderboard and how you repurpose it for others. As a “product” it could be sensational. $$$
3186,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"just checked it out, it's cool. Well done"
3187,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Do you have any plans on making a deep learning playlist?
3188,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Hey Ken, loved the way you built this project thank youu!!"
3189,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,I think this is a game changing idea. Like just the possibilities that could be achieved. Linking the viewer and the creator
3190,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Wow you are great
3191,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Here I come for prize 🏆😎
3192,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Great example of how a data science can be part-time developer. Thanks for the video.
3193,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,What does your rich friend do for a living please?
3194,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Engagement points: definitely a fun idea. Dedication to the implementation of said concept: admirable. Overall, inspiring to me as a newcomer in this community. I hadn't yet thought about the fact that such a community existed on Youtube, now I'm excited to see more of it. Thanks for the thought and time you put into this!"
3195,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Hello Ken, 

I think your leaderboard doesn't work now! it showed an error message."
3196,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Kenjee: this seems simple.
Project:- do you think so"
3197,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,What a fantastic and interactive way to increase engagement!
3198,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,awesome!
3199,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Smart move, very smart👍... I'm blown away"
3200,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Blown my mind! This is so relevant as I’ve mostly seen projects that focus on modeling and not an end to end. This gives a workflow on how you established. Thanks Ken.
3201,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Hey Ken this is actually great. It really good to have a leaderboard. As data science is very interesting but sometimes it's hard to watch the whole video 😂 no doubt content is amazing brother but it takes time for me as well probably 2-3 weeks for learning and understanding properly. I hope leaderboard will trigger me... More than gifts it will be more useful for learning...
3202,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Yo this is sick, can't believe i missed watching this till now. But dude thank you, if I made a leaderboard for which resource helped me most, your channel would be at the top as well. I'm def winning 2021 lol tough luck to everyone else"
3203,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Dude this is so awesome, not only is it useful and practical but also inspiring! Nice to see how all of these things come together. I hadn't a single clue what docker was until this video lol. Awesome work!"
3204,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,This is a nice way to keep engaged in learning and hustle for more. Because the prizes make you feel like you have made something good in your time.
3205,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Is there already video about your workspace, Ken Jee?!"
3206,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"It will be interesting to see if the act of measuring effects the dependent variables.
I suspect some people may now be reluctant to like a comment as it may detract from their own comment.

Maybe there should have been a blind benchmark for a period of time before announcing the leaderboard.

I suppose people could prove me wrong by liking this comment.
Checkmate."
3207,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"**Finally, a real project with clear goals and a clear explanation of the execution.
There needs to be more videos showing this type of real life data science/engineering.
Awesome job.**"
3208,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Another great work by you Ken Jee, keep the good work and sharing man! The use of Docker as the communicator was cool. :)"
3209,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,this is awesome. you will probably be the first :))
3210,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Ken Jee is the Data Science hero we all need....













But never deserve."
3211,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Hey! What 3x3 do you have?
3212,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"hehe😅 I just watched this video (I know too late)
It's an amazing way to interact with your viewers.
Love these videos ... very satisfying"
3213,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"hlo ken, is there any course or playlist in which u have implemented this project from scratch? .. actually i want to learn this to make my CV more impressive :)"
3214,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Great project! Wouldn’t it be better to have the Engagement Points formula like this =Comment Replies + Comment Likes - Num of Comments, so that only comments that get likes (i.e are useful for others) or create engagement (through replies) give you points? This would completely remove the option of getting EP through mass commenting. Just food for thought. Otherwise love the project and love your channel!"
3215,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Ken you're the man! Maybe you could give away resume reviews or mock interviews with you as well for aspiring and looking for work data scientists.
3216,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Make sure what you feed to the model: ""GARBAGE-IN -> GARBAGE-OUT""."
3217,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Appreciate the videos.  Keep up the good work
3218,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Me : sees the leader board
also Me : jumps to 9:08 PRIZES
 Me few minutes later : plans to comment on every single vid"
3219,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,How can I get all these into my head 😟
3220,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Oh man, I loved this video! I contacted a programmer about creating just THIS, an engagement scoreboard, months ago, but I didn't follow through. I'd love to purchase this service from you like... NOW! 😀"
3221,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Is there a way to see the score of a particular user, even if they are not in the top? (yeah, I want to know where I am haha)"
3222,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,This is awesome! Even though I barely understood a word of how you built this.. I'm definitely someone who's hesitant to engage in the comments (but look at me now?) Looking forward to your future videos.
3223,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,This is a very engaging comment.
3224,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,I actually like how you prevent spam. I was literally commenting a similar idea as you said it. Nice work.
3225,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Love the overall presentation of the video! Excellently done.
My own interaction with the YouTube API has been limited so far, well below the usage limits.
This is exactly the type of video I enjoy watching :)"
3226,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Such a cool project. Unfortunate about the Amazon trap. Jeff is good. Too good.
3227,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"I really love the spirit of this.  I'm also really thankful you're providing the source code.  I have a more traditional web app (JavaScript) background and am currently learning Data Science and Machine learning.  Short of the flask server from your previous video I've had a hard time picturing how a web application stack would look with data models.  Looking forward to how this grows, and welcome to the microservices black hole!"
3228,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Hi Ken, This looks cool! It’s interesting to see how a data scientist plays around the data. Though I’m still at the early stage of practicing basic skills and may not use these fancy tools soon, I’d like to have some fancy mindset. Thanks for sharing!"
3229,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,So cool!!
3230,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Nice project idea
3231,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Great idea!!
3232,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Incredible Work. Now I will need to create a Bot to Comment to your New Video.. I think this will help me To Get Ahead in Your Leaderboard... 
Sorry Bro .. We Dont have any other Option ...."
3233,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,You should make this a product that other creators can use. I am sure you have thought of it already though.
3234,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Wohoo.. that's really cool Ken.. I'm a beginner.. and I'm so much interested in knowing more about DS ☺️
3235,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Ken, this is really cool!"
3236,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"This is so sick... Thanks for the linked resources, this is the kind of thing I've always wanted to do!"
3237,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"You really are amazing man, as a beginner in ds am in a right place."
3238,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Great work. All Youtubers would like to use it which will encourage subs to participate more.
3239,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Now that's how a real data scientist work
*I have data*
*youtube algorithm wants comments for growth* 
*create a leaderboard with prizes*

Such a amazing idea, Respect"
3240,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,This is super cooool💫
3241,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"""I swear I'm not trying hard to get Ken's attention; I just need to comment on every video for the giveaway!"" Haha but seriously I think this is a good push to start engaging more with channels."
3242,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,What an interesting project. I’m curious to see how it turns out. Fantastic giveaways also. A very well done video. 8 love your subtle humor.😂
3243,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Let's just take a moment to appreciate how awesome Ken is ... truly an inspiration... as a data science student, you're my idol."
3244,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,The hiding memes in plain sight always gets me. Epic Intro and Nice ideas list. I'm happy that you didn't go with Human Sacrifice. :D :D :D
3245,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"This video! I love how you explained your step-by-step process so clear and visually. 
NGL at 9:08 I was waiting to see you end in a full-on Savasana on that yoga mat😜
This is such a wholesome project - great work Ken! :) and those dried shiitake mushrooms from Costco tho...😍"
3246,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Awesome project! The experience of running into one foe after another definitely hit home hard lol
3247,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,I'm coming for that #1 spot!
3248,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Ken tackles BIG YOUTUBE himself. Very nicely put together diagrams, excited to see who will top the charts Ken :)"
3249,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"My favorite part of this video is when Ken admits that it was a pain in the ass.  It's a cool project, but even some cool projects can be a PITA."
3250,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,This is incredible!!
3251,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Personally would have gone with ""More Dinosaurs,"" but hey. 

Love the 4DX concepts used here."
3252,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"This one is amazing 🔥 
Also i have one question 
Do data analyst need to work in office or can be done WFH too."
3253,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Great stuff! Need more about nba-api tho
3254,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"An amazing idea Ken!  I just signed up for a lot of courses in computer vision.  Its amazing you are partnered with Nvidea! Also, your setup with streamlit, docker and AWS is exactly the type of stuff I'm trying to get into.  Great job!"
3255,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"I love how you were able to make the information both educational and entertaining. Like you took us on the journey. Do you recommend learning SQL, while learning python?"
3256,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Big fan of this initiative. I think there is a lot of potential in learning from comment data. What were some of your machine learning ideas that you're looking into?
3257,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,This is SO cool. Thanks for sharing Ken! 🙌
3258,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Please make a tutorial for the same... I'll be more than happy 😊
3259,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Congrats Ken!
3260,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,I am happy someone is using streamlit 😜
3261,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Hey this is pretty neat! I noticed you hadn't uploaded recently and I was curious why. Definitely was worth the wait. I also like how you dealt with the possible spam commenters. The NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute is a cool idea for a prize. I've done some of those courses myself and thought they were very much worth it.
3262,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,What about me 🥺 I’m watching your EVERY VIDEO and I don’t skip the ads so you can make a buck... I’m always giving a like too ❣️ Also loving the podcasts but i dont comment on them bc nothing good comes to my mind. I didn’t do it for the prize though it’s only pure love ❤️
3263,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"This is one of the best projects I have come across @ken Jee, Nice Work! 👍🏻💯💥"
3264,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"This idea was so brilliant. It's not Ken Jee anymore, it's GOD JEE now."
3265,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"This is really a great initiative to encourage the usage of data in real life.
really get to learn so much from you & your channel content. Just keep making & improving the quality of your videos. it's awesome.
one quick suggestion: why not making your Intro of the video, little bit minimalistic (or in DS words, make it clean for exploratory analysis hehe).
thanks Kenneth."
3266,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,One word... COOL.... 😍
3267,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"How about uploading a series explaining how you built those integrations?

After finishing my ""first ds project from scratch"" I decided to take the next step which is to put a script on a virtual machine and build a SQL database. Lol"
3268,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Oh my God, Ken! You amazed me with the cool project that I never thought it would be interesting. I also like how you explained the flow charts easily and smoothly. Thanks for sharing the resources as well! Keep up the good work towards the end of 2020!"
3269,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,It's cool! Hope you will make a playlist on how to set up this from scratch :D and again thank you Ken for your informative videos. I am a newbie and I am learning a lot from these.

3279,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Very cool way to engage with your community. I used Docker a bit for work but I have still learn a lot about it. Also I have yet to tried server less lambda.
3280,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"This is phenomenal!!! Yes, 3 exclamation points phenomenal.  Solving problems while trying to solve a problem.

I was just thinking to myself yesterday, too ""I haven't seen Ken post any videos lately, is he abandoning us for the podcast?""

Always fascinated by watching the process play out. Great video"
3281,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"I am satisfied with my performance :P ...at least in the list.  I wanted a keyboard... But working on the project so will try my best in the community..You have a long way to go Ken...Be the same soft spoken yet slightly funny but at the end an honest guy...and as always thank you, mentor..."
3282,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,COMMENT FOR THE LEADERBOARD
3283,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Very Cool project Ken :)
3284,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Just curious, why did you use the EC2 server instead of another scheduled lambda for populating the SQL instance?"
3285,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"I like that u always find a way to explore the things and make valuable project, which always intrigued me!!"
3286,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"When the video started, i thought ""Oh this seems pretty simple, I can maybe try it later""
And then everything later went over my head lol."
3287,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,This is so cool! I am working on a 'not so great' project too (since the last 1 month lol).
3288,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"oh, you napping, hugging something you love <3 

Interesting project, looking forward to see your collab with Tina too. I too have an idea for a small DS project based on yt data (haven't seen many DS projects based on yt data as opposed to tons and tons of projects based on Twitter data), so I'm really curious what you guys will do."
3289,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,"Hell yeah, another project video! These are the best! Very cool stuff you did with this one, even though I didn't get much of the advanced topics yet

But I'd love to see another one of those step-by-step project like you did with the DS jobs code. You planning on doing something like that?"
3290,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,No project is simple when it comes to implementation 🤕
3291,I Built the FIRST EVER YouTube Subscriber LEADERBOARD,Okay now I'm excited for next year 🤜 I didn't understand all the technical stuff but the project is very interesting .. Can't wait to see your video with Tina

3302,Is Data Science Dying?,"Hi Ken, I'm 37 years old and from Banking industry. Studied accountancy and economics. I have been contemplating about doing data science for past a couple of years as i have never felt too confident about it.

Data is definitely important but people doing masters/major in statistics will have upper hand to people who are doing data science course with no prior engineering background.
Also, people who know various coding languages might again have upper hand.
Rest you have in the job training.

Please share your response. I want to learn data science but I'm not feeling too confident about it's future for someone with my background."
3303,Is Data Science Dying?,Another great example outside of data science is medical laboratory science. Over the years it has become more and more automated with more machines doing lab tests.. but all that has created is the ability to do more volume. We need people to interpret the results and make sure they are okay. Machines break down all the time and the job is VERY much in demand.
3304,Is Data Science Dying?,People need it.  If they say they don't they are hiring the skills under multiple / different job titles.
3305,Is Data Science Dying?,"As an accountant I can tell you the reason why you are not seeing any data scientists in small to midsize companies is because they cannot justify the head count.  Sure Amazon can have a whole department for data science but a small business you might be the marketing/finance guy who is also analyzing the other data sets for the company.  The field is not dying, but with tight budgets in small to midsize companies it is hard to justify hiring hiring someone who specializes in data science but cannot do any other core business function.  But that will probably change as time goes on.

Also, as companies grow then the need for data scientists will grow as well."
3306,Is Data Science Dying?,In my surroundings I can tell that the reason why students aren't taking data science is because they find statistics too hard and also consider web development and devops as a likeable and easy field.
3307,Is Data Science Dying?,"Of course it will exist.  The world needs vampires. These are not my personal goals, just how I see Data Science.  Data science as i see it....  Goal 1. Stalk and Harrass.  Goal 2.  Manipulation and deception. Goal 3. Ripoff the naive and uninitiated."
3308,Is Data Science Dying?,"This seems to be a silly thing that I see all the time with anything connected to coding. I've been learning to code (and now getting into data science) for about a year and a half. I have seen so many comments like is JavaScript dying? Is web development dying? Is Deno dead already? Even when people ask ""Is JQuery dead?'"" then you realise how many sites still use JQuery. The answer to the ""Is it dead/dying?"" question is usually ""no"""
3309,Is Data Science Dying?,"I feel it’s cuz YouTube data community is growing and every other day, it seem as thou there’s more new people then not. Feels like by the time I grad in 5years, not much of the pie would be left for newbies?"
3310,Is Data Science Dying?,"No-code really is just a new buzzword that means what ""democratization"" used to mean.

It lets unskilled people do what we do so we can learn the new hotness in our field. I used to be a web analyst. When Google Analytics started interpreting itself, I moved on to software skills and ML skills.

No-code is good. As soon as we get comfortable with techniques, they are no longer cutting edge. So they're boring. No-code offloads that shit to our stakeholders so we can move on to the new cool stuff."
3311,Is Data Science Dying?,AutoML pretty scary...
3312,Is Data Science Dying?,Today I just got into college for artificial intelligence and data science  BTEC and Google recommend your article
3313,Is Data Science Dying?,"Hi Ken, thanks for your good sharing of data science! I've been working for a BI company for 5 months as a project manager. We set up data warehouses and develop Power BI dashboards for many customers in a big variety of industries (cosmetic, food, electronic, medicine, clinic, hotel, aquaculture., etc.) The business is pretty good. Some of them have started using machine learning for prediction. So I think that data science is trending upward."

3318,Is Data Science Dying?,"Hi there Thank you for your video first of all.I have Statistics bachelor degree I've never work as a statistician.Im really into jumping  UX/UI design career, but since my bachelor so relevant with data scientist I'm having a little bit hard time to decide. I'm thinking to have bootcamp and have zero coding experience. I like math but also I love searching, psychology and being creative . what your suggestion would be for me ? Ux designer or data scientist ? Ux designer excites me more, but I'm having fear how hard finding a job will be.Data scientist scares me to learn and personally have low interest but I wanna find job easily and kinda don't wanna feel my bachelor degree was a waste."
3319,Is Data Science Dying?,Good vid
3320,Is Data Science Dying?,"Really enjoyed this video! I really don't understand why people would ask if data science is a dying trend/industry/discipline etc. With more data becoming available and languages/tools like Python and R getting regular updates, there will always be a need for those skills and I personally don't see any of this becoming obsolete. I can see why data science as a title might render it declining trend but I wouldn't focus so much on what constitutes data science. Also you need to keep making content so this discipline cannot die!!!"
3321,Is Data Science Dying?,"I am just starting to learn Data Science With python & Machine learning with python.
This type of articles just demotivated me Dear. I want to do Job in USA as a Data Scientist.
I am from India"
3322,Is Data Science Dying?,Maths & Stats will live FOREVER. Data Science is a supportive tool to MATHS & STATS.
3323,Is Data Science Dying?,"What everyone including companies themselves fail to understand is that when they are asking for data scientists, and ML engineers, they are really wanting to be disrupting their own business before someone else does it for them. AI and data science are just strongly associated with digital disruption. When viewed through this lens, data professionals will be needed but the work they do and technologies they use will evolve. The role of digital disruption by making use of data through whatever technology is available is what people should focus on to remain relevant."
3324,Is Data Science Dying?,Down
3325,Is Data Science Dying?,Is it true in India...... Vacancy very less for data science
3326,Is Data Science Dying?,"Data science is statistics.... 
Its not a fashion trend.. 
Its like saying the laws of motion are out of fashion.... 😑🙄"
3327,Is Data Science Dying?,that shirt is 🔥🔥🔥
3328,Is Data Science Dying?,"There will never be any decline in any of the IT field and its Skills ,be it Data Science or Development or Testing...!
What will decline is people's mindset to learn new things at any point and adapt through it.

Same is the scenario in any other field.... Demands increase doesn't mean it's value will decrease later !!!

People should stick to their individual Skill rather than hype of new trend !!!!"

3330,Is Data Science Dying?,"I'm finding that in my company, we are only just walking up to data science and I'm pleased to hear there is a demand in for data science. Would be in a mess if it wasn't because I'm studying into data science whilst using the skills in my company and hoping to change careers fully into data science"
3331,Is Data Science Dying?,I'm glad to have stumbled upon your account! I'm interested in learning more about the field and business world and am looking forward to listening to your insights across videos.

3333,Is Data Science Dying?,"Data analysis is a time consuming process and no miracle can take place if you create a data model and take a call based on the outcome. Data science mostly help companies in making marketing and sales decision - these final decision will always stay with the people who are marketing and sales veterans. In essence, companies will always look for data scientists but not to depend on them solely but rather to use them as a helping tool for core veterans of companies. Nobody in right mind will change a product price solely based on a data model. So yes, the demand for data scientists will eventually slow down."
3334,Is Data Science Dying?,Thank you for clarifying and busting the myths. You rock!! :)
3335,Is Data Science Dying?,👍🏾
3336,Is Data Science Dying?,One thing I can attest to is that it's getting far more stressful as the purview grows.
3337,Is Data Science Dying?,"Omg you scared me with the title.
.l..I'm learning DS and wish to continue with this career path"
3338,Is Data Science Dying?,What about machine learning ?
3339,Is Data Science Dying?,I use data science  for gambling
3340,Is Data Science Dying?,Non relevant comment: As the like #1234 i feel accomplished i life.
3341,Is Data Science Dying?,"Respected Ken Sir,

Greetings, I hope you will be fine.

Ken this is Awais Ahmad, I just need your 5 min's.

Want to ask, I'm desperately looking for the Internship/Job to support my family related to Data Science, Data Analyst/Database developer/ETL,BI develoepr/ role. I hope you can help me.

Thanks & Best Regards,

Awais Ahmad"
3342,Is Data Science Dying?,I am just about to graduate from my Data Science Masters.
3343,Is Data Science Dying?,"Mathematics never dies. Programming Languages are rising and decline,  but calculus,  matrices and numerics will exists until the known universe ends"
3344,Is Data Science Dying?,"In Strategic Management of Technology, Data Science would be still in the early stage of the S-curve. We are far from maturity what else a decline."
3345,Is Data Science Dying?,"As for AutoAI/AI GUI I been using one given by my company but the performance has only been surpar. I am using it more as a pipeline designer so less technical coworkers who are not comfortable with code can use it. On the other hand, fine tuning pretrained model has much better results and I think models trained by big tech companies will dominant in the next 5 years. 
I also agree with your point with data engineering as I have spent a lot of time in this area. 
So my 2 cents is Transfer learning tuning w/ preprocessing > AutoAI.

My data will eventually output to some low code/no code applications, but I don't see how those application will replace software engineers/developers. I hope this is the same situation for us data scientist."
3346,Is Data Science Dying?,"I think part of it is the pressure for the next content piece. There are only so many ‘do data science’ posts/videos you can do before saturation. Also, you’re right about the absorption of these roles by different businesses and sectors over time, each part has lead firms then a long tail who take time to adapt to these trends."
3347,Is Data Science Dying?,"By 2030, data science as we know it won't exist.  The demand for DS will be much smaller after transformational automation is complete.   A large percentage of roles will fall back to traditional analytical functions such as accounting and finance and the smaller data science function will be the sole preserve of the Ph.D. who will maintain high salary levels but the rest of the data science fodder will have to look elsewhere for large paydays.    Right now the value that can be delivered by DS is very high but this will become marginal over time so $130K+ starting salaries for DS roles will become a thing of the past for all except the cream of the Ph.D. crop."
3348,Is Data Science Dying?,"Data science is big but being able to interpret and provide insights from the data is where the money is. Lots of people can pull data and code using R, python etc..but if you can't explain how to use that results for predictive forecast or explaining how it either proves or disapproves your initial hypothesis then data analytics does not add any value."
3349,Is Data Science Dying?,Those who think Data Science is dying are actually the ones who are overcome by self-doubt before even starting to actually try and get on the learning curve. So they spout such baseless statements to appease themselves and justify their unwillingness to learn such a fascinating field.
3350,Is Data Science Dying?,I am sure data science is not dying but the way we did data science today might be different in future.
3351,Is Data Science Dying?,a clickbait(maybe not) is worth watching. Thank you Ken
3352,Is Data Science Dying?,"Hello Ken have to agree with you, and as trends or tools change, your already one step ahead in learning whatever comes along. Data Analyst is a good starting point but not end all. The more tools you have the better your chances of advancing. That is my two bits. Have a wonderful holiday"
3353,Is Data Science Dying?,"Hey Ken, your video is such a bliss as always. I am working as System Analyst aged 41 years. Can I learn Data Science at this age and start my career in it? 
What advice you have for me?"
3354,Is Data Science Dying?,True data scientist would go and check statistics :d
3355,Is Data Science Dying?,i literally just got some clarity in this subject and people are saying its dying come on!!!
3356,Is Data Science Dying?,So becoming a data analyst or business analyst is definitely worth it. As well as learning python for various reasons
3357,Is Data Science Dying?,"How can data science die if it's always been there? Everything we do is based on the data we collect, and that will continue to happen. 
People don't know what they don't know."
3358,Is Data Science Dying?,FYI in Israel there's a very very big demand for data scientists and a very short supply
3359,Is Data Science Dying?,Data science jobs are reaching the SWE jobs number. So I guess its nt going to die anytime soon
3360,Is Data Science Dying?,I see not much confidence on Ken's face though!
3361,Is Data Science Dying?,Whether  block chain technology kills data scientist role ?
3362,Is Data Science Dying?,It will merge with Data Engineer. ^Did not watched
3363,Is Data Science Dying?,I think entry level roles for data science are getting pretty saturated and competitive. This might create the impression of less demand for some people. However the value of a veteran data scientist is hard to overstate.
3364,Is Data Science Dying?,But is it too late to become a data science YouTube influencer???
3365,Is Data Science Dying?,"I hope not, I just enrolled in a Masters in DS ha"
3366,Is Data Science Dying?,Excellent analysis Ken. I admire your effort to reduce bias (and maybe increase variance).
3367,Is Data Science Dying?,"Just recently started my first role as a data analyst/consultant for a property consultancy, people in other teams and companies have told me about the struggle they are having finding data analysts.  I'm from the UK so this may of course differ where you are living but its clear new companies are realising how imporant data is."
3368,Is Data Science Dying?,"I always think that data science and analyst job will be replaced by AI. It is not that hard. The future is about human interactions. All human capabilities can be performed (even better) by computers. I also read many articles about this and, the truth is yes, the future jobs will be the ones which requires cognitive, psycology and sense of human beings."
3369,Is Data Science Dying?,Why the hell would it die
3370,Is Data Science Dying?,Do you think someone going through college whose interested in data science be better off majoring in computer science or data science?
3371,Is Data Science Dying?,No Data science is a teeneager... It will not die as early as some ppl are thinking... Live long data science...
3372,Is Data Science Dying?,"As a student in Data Science, in order to automate those tasks, AI needs to be much more advanced in order to actually do it so its still pretty far off."
3373,Is Data Science Dying?,"Thanks, Ken, for the great insights. I don't see data science dying but just continuously evolving. It better not be too late to start your data science career because I'm probably going to set the age record for getting started! Thank you so much for the way you keep me challenged to continue growing. 

BTW, I took your recommendation to get Aurelien Geron's ML book because I needed another resource to bolster my green ML skills. Great find!"
3374,Is Data Science Dying?,"The sentiment is maybe coming from the difficulties to find your fist job if you are an aspiring data scientist. Rejection and unclear expectations (most companies have no idea how to find and sort data-scientists) may make many believe that is was just a fad, and they came a little late to the party."
3375,Is Data Science Dying?,"Ken Jee hit the nail on the head perfectly. The general public, major business and especially the media have little to no understanding what data science and diversity of roles in this field. 

Since the field is much newer than others, how would anyone who communicates about value it or hold it in regard to any other white collar job? So when people want to move on to write about the next hot topic trend, or lack understanding of the subjects projected growth, its just easier to say it is dying."
3376,Is Data Science Dying?,Is death dying ?
3377,Is Data Science Dying?,"I couldn't help but notice the b-roll of fruit, coconuts, woodroses, and banana trees, are you in Hawai'i?"
3378,Is Data Science Dying?,"I saw GPT3 and thought, welp, most software engineering jobs are going to get booted. 
Tell me if I’m wrong. And also if this could spillover to data science."
3379,Is Data Science Dying?,"There is a problem with those statistics.
If data scientist jobs grow from 1000 to 10000 that's nothing really even if it has a huuuuuge percentage in increase.
Plus, you are almost DEAD if you look for an entry level position."
3380,Is Data Science Dying?,"Very solid arguments. Even though the title might change, the skill sets will definitely always be in demand."
3381,Is Data Science Dying?,I also think causal inference will be more popular in the future of data science which is more difficult to automate than prediction as it requires more interpretability
3382,Is Data Science Dying?,"Greetings Ken Jee!
What should we do when finding conflicts between packages version in anaconda-venv?

Thnx .."
3383,Is Data Science Dying?,Let's cut the crap: the only reason people write articles saying data science is dying is to be edgy and get clicks.
3384,Is Data Science Dying?,"I think companies are realizing they need data engineers more than data scientists. I see 4 data engineers for every 1 data scientists. I also see a lot of overlap between data scientists and analysts, yet one gets paid significantly more for having a fancy title, but can’t write basic sql lol. Why not just have ML Engineer, Software Engineer, and Analyst all under Data Operations or Data Analytics and Engineering? The need for all these titles are annoying and unnecessary."
3385,Is Data Science Dying?,Always a great video master master Ken! I think with Alteryx a lot of people feel a lot of these jobs are being automated and everyone can run a model.  But I found many of people who just run these workflows can't really explain the results when you ask detailed questions.  There's always going be work for some cookie cutter projects but there will always be room for when you need to innovate and a cookie cutter approach won't be the best solution.  Totally agree with your analysis! Keep up the great work! Happy early ThanksGiving!
3386,Is Data Science Dying?,The field will continue to rise but slow down! AND will morph!
3387,Is Data Science Dying?,"In Germany, there are now new courses of study only for Data Science. I'm in the first semester and am already very excited. Data Science is the future, thanks for the video 😊"
3388,Is Data Science Dying?,"1:05
To prove if DATA science is going up or down we see the DATA.....

Hence, proved that it isn't going down 😏😏"
3389,Is Data Science Dying?,"Hello!

I have a question and it is In case we are new in data science and do not have work experience in data science, what is your recommendation to get into a data science job?
And I have another question and that is, what projects would you recommend us to do in order to we can know if we are prepared for a data science job or not. Thank you so much!"
3390,Is Data Science Dying?,"To me the new Google phone is proof that data science and ML are literally just getting started, I mean the phone has a ""Tensor"" processing unit, and it's most advertised features are Deep Learning enabled."
3391,Is Data Science Dying?,"Agree, data science in not dying. It's for many reasons still in infancy stage, so a lot more to come."
3392,Is Data Science Dying?,"I really like you Ken, but educational content that's I want... Instead of getting uncertain topics like thisss"
3393,Is Data Science Dying?,"I’m starting to learn data science with a mind towards still being employable in 2050. No matter whether the job of “data scientist” is around then, the skills learned in the job will be invaluable. Analysis, data architecture, machine learning, data visualization, Python and R, all of these skills will allow data scientists to be on the cutting edge of any new tools developed between then and now. And big data is getting bigger by the second. Barring some kind of AGI singularity, data science should continue on an upward trend.

Thanks Ken for all the help in your videos so far, and for confirming my hunch that the field is going strong."
3394,Is Data Science Dying?,"The Data Wiz has spoken ..Now that's clear "" Data Science isn't Dying""  

Totally agree with your point ken where you mentioned that when companies and people would be able to understand the difference between different data roles , these questions wouldn't be coming again n again  ...

Also i feel you should title your videos as Data  Myth Buster by ken :)"
3395,Is Data Science Dying?,"to the moon, diamond hands"
3396,Is Data Science Dying?,"Great insights as always Ken! The data science umbrella is so large, that several ""titles"" will be more defined by companies to find the person with the skill set required to solve their problems."
3397,Is Data Science Dying?,But in these days we have less job opportunities in this field donno about future
3398,Is Data Science Dying?,"When I was 12 years old, I wanted to learn HTML and JavaScript to build my own website that had guitars and penguins on it.

All the so-called ""smart"" ""adults"" around me said that programming was a waste of time because all the programming jobs would get outsourced to other countries anyways and that programming was too hard for people who weren't good at math (like me). Not knowing anything, I decided to listen to them.

Fast forward 4-14 years later, there are self-taught programmers who don't know much math and never went to college, who are now making high 6 figures and I missed that opportunity because I listened too much to other people when I was 12. 

Don't listen to people who aren't experts in the field you are exploring.

Data science today is what HTML and web development was in 1997. It's not that new but it is still growing fast enough and there's plenty of room for more data scientists and computer programmers."
3399,Is Data Science Dying?,"I think easy entry to data science is dying however skilled data science entry is increasing in demand.

The main barrier is how many are going to squeeze every neuron in their brain to truly work to their potential and capacity to be skilled and make value in this field."
3400,Is Data Science Dying?,"@3:50, yes, Web Developers are still in high demand, but today their pay rate and demand isn't the same as it was back in the 90's and 00's

Wouldn't be surprised if the same happens with Data Analysts / Scientists"
3401,Is Data Science Dying?,"My assumption - no analysis - was that there is a glut of data science boot camp graduates - plus the disconnect I've seen mentioned between people who study things like NLP and image recognition, which are not in demand in the workforce.  Probably part of it for me is just that - i dont want to be a data scientist.  I'm more interested in data profiling and analysis and modeling.  I actually was turned down for a role I didnt realy want - because while the role said 'data analyst' they really wanted a junior data scientist - someone who WANTED to be a data scientist.  
I stumbled in to a great role, though, I think!"
3402,Is Data Science Dying?,Great video Ken! Completely agree that data science is on the rise as companies are just realising the full potential 🚀
3403,Is Data Science Dying?,On the rise. Data never dies. It will grow. How good ai is doing is also a data.
3404,Is Data Science Dying?,You sound like ELON MUSK😄
3405,Is Data Science Dying?,"Hi ken ! I wanted to ask u this question last time when we discussed the video but I thought Youtube would be better. I am applying for a PhD in the states and considering specializing in NLP. I am also considering working on applied fields like climatology or environmental economics since I come from an econ background, but ofc the algorithms are the same ( no DL there ofc ) .. I just want to get your opinion on that if possible, but ofc don't worry I won't take it as Quran in my case lol ( It means a lot to me tho 🌻 )"
3406,Is Data Science Dying?,"Great insights. Thank you. 
I’m just a beginner in Data Science and headlines like this pop up every once in a while. 😂"
3407,Is Data Science Dying?,"The lack of focus on data leadership and waste from hype, we're just not seeing a lot of feasible products and services that companies know what to do with or want to pay for.

There's significant abrasion between the skills that are professed via Google and what companies actually need done.  With that being said, there are a lot of newbies unwilling to make a commitment to the career.  When they find out it's not just pushing buttons in Anaconda, they bail.

Will data science grow or will companies adapt to what's available in the software and labor market when the hype dies?  Or will they just keep throwing money into the unknown?"
3408,Is Data Science Dying?,I agree!!
3409,Is Data Science Dying?,It won't die because nothing truly dies in life. It all just gets recycled or sent to the Lord's Kingdom in Heaven. Just always have faith! Data Science will be in a better place someday
3410,Is Data Science Dying?,"Thanks Ken ! I am finishing my last year in Industrial Engineering and your videos motivated me to try learning DS as a side hustle. To be honest with you, it seems really overwhelming at first because the field is gigantic and i am trying to keep the pace with my Uni studies and my part time job... all of this at the same time... Currently i am using Dataquest to learn the basics (Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, SQL, etc.). but sometimes the motivation hits all time low even though i am in love with this new domain. Do you have some quick and effectif tips with this issue ? Thanks Again."
3411,Is Data Science Dying?,Great video Mr.Jee thanks for your sharing your knowledge
3412,Is Data Science Dying?,"Great video Ken! I definitely see the field trending up from an employer's perspective. Like you said, so many companies that aren't the FAANG companies are just starting to get to grips with the amount of data that they have available to them and will need to hire more and more data scientists as they seek to extract insights from their data."
3413,Is Data Science Dying?,"As someone who's a relatively new data scientist, thanks for giving me all the confirmation bias that I needed Ken 😉"
3414,Is Data Science Dying?,"Top video, thanks for the quality insight"
3415,Is Data Science Dying?,Data science is definitely not dying and for the fact it's only scaling much bigger. Companies have started seeing the advantage of using data and data science and organisations are adopting data which is in fact create more demand for data experts 💯.
3416,Is Data Science Dying?,Definitely think it on the upwards trend
3417,Is Data Science Dying?,"The Data Science King 🤴 has spoken; Data Science is NOT DYING!!

Very much agree with this, Ken!  I also will add that I feel there is going to be a stronger need for data engineering as we go into the future."
3418,Is Data Science Dying?,Long live data scince😂
3419,Is Data Science Dying?,Yea I agree with you totally
3420,Is Data Science Dying?,Thanks for the awesome analysis. I think data science is still on the rise. I think because it's a bit hard to get into the industry especially for beginners makes it seem like it's on the decline.
3421,Is Data Science Dying?,"That's really on point. People see advancements in tech and join the bandwagon of making predictions about the decline of human jobs. I think we have not yet realised that automated solutions would most probably be generic and not user specific. In this field of ever growing competition, users would be looking for more personalized solutions and for that, we would require people."
3422,Is Data Science Dying?,This video hit the net at a perfect time for me. Applying now and this gives me the confidence that there are junior DS roles to be filled and not the plethora of senior data science listings I've come across. Thanks Ken 🙏
3423,Is Data Science Dying?,"Hey Ken, love your stuff, what advice would you have for someone who’s soon to be graduated with a masters in data science who now only sees anxiety inducing videos like this? 😬 what skills could someone like me look to add that are less likely to become automated or phased out?"
3424,Is Data Science Dying?,"Data scientists who have some knowledge of a non-tech domain will be in great demand too. In sports, its advantages are manifold and its usage is on a rise."
3425,Is Data Science Dying?,"Great insights Ken. I certainly agree that data science's decline is far from sight. In the life science domain, the use of data science has started to scratch the surface and there's a whole new frontier of possibilities."
3426,Is Data Science Dying?,"I don't think it's gonna die anytime soon. Companies which uses data to grow their business have a significant upper hand on businesses who don't. So, even if the new entrepreneurs don't want to use data, they still will have to use it otherwise they are gonna get beaten easily by their competitor's who are using it. And the fact that people give away their data 24/7 , you need someone to analyse that, so data science is probably on the rise in my opinion, no doubt at all"
3427,Is Data Science Dying?,"Okay, BUT HOW DO YOU FIND PERFECT CLIPS FOR EVERYTHING!"
3428,Is Data Science Dying?,Good to hear that :)
3429,Is Data Science Dying?,"Hey Ken, thank you for your insights! Btw, I'm seeing Blockchain developer jobs are on the rise and Blockchain maybe the next big thing. Do you agree? Is there an intersection between the two kinds of jobs (BC and DS) or are they mutually exclusive?"
3430,Is Data Science Dying?,Data Science is growing
3431,Is Data Science Dying?,Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know if you think data science is on the rise or decline below!

Thank you really for everything you share with us. I've started my journey in data science a couple months ago. I completed a bachelor's degree in statistics and I would like to convert into Data scientist.
I have some questions for you and I thank you in advance for your answers.
- with my statistician background, do you think I can be good enough to have a job in datascience?
- I have completed datascience 365 bootcamp and I want to know ways to apply all the knowledge I got there.
- how can I find a distance job in any company or enterprise, because in my home country it is quiet difficult since we don't have enterprises really needing it.

Thanks a lot and I don't know if I can get your mail for further discussions. Thanks"

3531,5 Essential Data Science Projects for Your Portfolio,"Hey Ken, I'm back to pick your brain and get your insight again lol. For deploying machine learning models, what cloud service is most used in the industry? Obviously it depends on the model and the use case but I'm having a hard time figuring out what cloud service to use. 

I was doing a bunch of research on turning one of my models into a productionized web app and I was trying to decide between AWS and Heroku. Heroku is definitely way easier and way more hands off but would it look better from a hiring managers perspective if I took the time to learn some devops and fired up an AWS instance with my model running on it? Or does it not really matter and Heroku is fine to use as it is convenient 

Thanks if you see this and all the amazing work you do! :D"

I thought the basic github pages video before was good enough, but this produces quite a professionally finished product, in 45mins and FREE! So happy that you made this.

1 question: once you’ve done an initial commit and the website is up, how do you then do a small update? Do you edit it locally again and upload the whole “public” folder again to the GitHub repo? Or is there some more efficient way?"

Data Professor],"So on 31st May I searched youtube for ""Data science portfolio website"" and found this awesome video posted just 2 days before! I have made my first portfolio website thanks to you guys!! Thank you!!
One heads up for anyone making their own site in this way:
After uploading files some of the images might not load on the page (when run using Github pages)
This happens because some images that were uploaded have the src = ""/images/.."" 
To get the photos simply edit the index.html file for the pages where the images are missing. 
Change the ""/images/.."" to  ""https://dataprofessor.github.io/Ken_Portfolio/images/.."" and the images will show
This was something I faced and that's how I fixed it. Hope this helps and hope you all make the website you want!"

3699,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"instead of dropping an ""Unnamed: 0"" column, we can pass the ""index_col = 0"" argument in the first place when we define the df variable as our dataFrame variable.

maybe looks like this
df = pd.read_csv('glassdoor_jobs.csv', index_col=0)

the documentation says ""index_col=False can be used to force pandas to not use the first column as the index,""

correct me if i'm wrong. 

hey by the way, what a nice playlist, i enjoyed it. thanks ken, big thumbs up"
3700,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Somebody might have commented already, but in more recent data pulls some salaries are more precise thus they don't have a range so edited the lambda for max salary checking len(x.split('-') first to avoid out of range errors"
3701,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hi, I am entering into the Data Science world and I have an easy question:

 I am using Sublime Text and not Spider. When I plot my dataframe there (df = pd.read_csv('glassdoor_jobs.csv'; print(df)) I do not get a terminal where I can explore the whole data (like Ken does). Instead what I get is the df cut off. I can explore it by using some commands like "".head(20)/.tail(20)/etc..."" and specifying the columns that I want to be shown, but it's kind of annoying and you may not find some variables that need to be cleaned by doing that.

Does anyone know what could I do to display the whole dataframe outside Sublime Text to explore it? 

Ty very much!"

3706,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hi Ken, I first want to say following these vids has been amazing so far.

Quick Question, sometimes I get the following error: 
StaleElementReferenceException: stale element reference: element is not attached to the page document

I think It may have something to do with my internet connection, because it happens randomly during the scraping process.

I guess the question is does the file have to feature 1000 entries? I think working with a smaller data pool might prevent the random error. Will something like 500 or even 250 work?"
3707,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),I am absolutely LOVING this series! I've been studying for a while and always wondered how an actual data scientist would use all these tools on an actual project. Great work Ken! Just found your channel today and I have a feeling I'll go through your videos really fast
3708,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"I really shouldn’t have laughed at 30:16 when Ken’s like “yea sorry about the sirens. You know, tough times out there”.

3718,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),love you brother ❤
3719,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Thanks for the video Ken. I have a question on saving the datafile after the cleaning process.  Though not applicable in this video--when I clean up dates and some string fields--saving as .csv loses all those changes. Then the beginning of my EDA is doing that cleanup for the fields the csv does not save. Is this normal? Am I missing something? Appreciate the help. Be well.
3720,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),lamba function is actually quite useful! damn.

3729,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"For the cleaning, can I use Excel as well and then save as .CSV and load back into the   code?"
3730,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),btw the output console at 29:00 shows that Los Angeles is counted as a state(but it's not)
3731,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Great video, thanks so much! I noticed that if you use '  r  ' (whitespace on each side of the r) you get some of the r results that otherwise would have been missed by only using 'r studio' and 'r-studio' in the lambda function"
3732,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hi Ken, i just started this series and i am at 23:44 as of the time writing this comment. i think you mixed the hourly and annual salary which can skew your data.

e.g. $28/hour = ~58K p.a. (40h/week, 52 weeks)

since you replaced $ and K you will use the 28 for your average calculation instead of the 58.

But since you marked them in the additional column im sure that you adress this issue in the video."

This looks like a very quality series! Great content! I especially like that we see the whole iterative process of a project and the googling and looking things up and everything. Very nice :)
3734,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"This is actually so good for me understand the concept while you are doing the project and also I think maybe cause of dark mode I am not able to see properly on my mobile I will try watching somewhere else but other than this series is worth it 
I hope you make a new series of project with another idea💯😊👏"
3735,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),🙏🏼
3736,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Great job again. As people already mentioned, uploading the video without editing enable us to understand the process and be more confident that ""trial and error"" is part of the process.

Also, you should add a highlight to that moment when you checked the company foundation date, this is a really important sanity check.

Obs. Apply seems amazing. I write a lot of bad code to do the cleaning, it is embarrassing haha"
3737,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Man, this series you made is the most important video in my learning by far. Thanks to you I realize I'm already can start building projects and work more on my portfolio. I was always thinking I'm not ready enough but with your series, I realize that I know what to do. I can't say how much your series had helped me. Thank you!"
3738,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"thanks ken, really appreciate the effort in these vids 

i faced an issue with the state split 
[
df['job_state'] = df['Location'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',')[1])
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File ""<ipython-input-32-5c1b9e64688a>"", line 1, in <module>

    df['job_state'] = df['Location'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',')[1])

IndexError: list index out of range
]

says index out of range although i splitted on comma so if any1 faces the same issue i would recommend doing what i did 
replace 
df['job_state'] = df['Location'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',')[1])
with
df['job_state']= df.apply(lambda x: x['Location'][-2:], axis=1)
we took -2 as all the states are 2 characters at the end"
3739,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),within the dataset there are some observations preappended with 'salary:' so int() is throwing an error at this point of getting the min & max salaries. to get that out of the way.i did this: minus_hr = minus_hr.apply(lambda x: x.split(':')[1] if 'salary' in x.lower() else x)
3740,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Wow, I love these series! Very helpful and inspiring"
3741,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),This guy is amazing!
3742,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),lambda > loop statements
3743,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),I love this series! Please don't stop making these videos.....
3744,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hi Ken!
Great video and value, I learned alot. I have one question:
Why did you make a separate column for ""Employer provided salary""? It makes sense to me to simply remove it from text and treat it as regular salary. What is your opinion on this?"
3745,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),i like the series but zoom in required for videos
3746,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),This is just amazing Ken ! now I know that's the kind of job I wanna do for a living :) thank you so much for sharing !
3747,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Lmao! U have good quality. Freshers like us should follow ur style.😜
3748,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hey Ken,  

Not sure what you're reasoning or purpose of creating your Youtube videos are, but you've been an inspiration towards me, and if you get down or whatever, just know that you've helped me alot."
3749,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"what a clear explanation man, hats off..:)"
3750,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"i'm already equipped with basic python knowledge,  how do i begin Data Science"
3751,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hi Ken, I am not able perform below code in python 3 - giving me error
df['min_salary'] = min_hr.apply(lambda x: int(x.split('-')[0]))
When I am using [1] then it's giving me max value but not min with [0]"
3752,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Thanks for all the effort you put in Ken. It takes a lot of effort and time in making these videos which will help you and as well as the community.

I had enormous interest towards sports and I do want to contribute to the field .However I came across your videos and i really like the way those videos were organised.Keep your good work mate"
3753,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Excellent. this is very helpful.
3754,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Thank you! Awesome!
3755,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"I think you could have searched ' R ' to find more about R studio, because it's hard for someone to write a  R like that ..."
3756,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"In 37:40 ish , you copied the code from above and edit for the excel function, but u forgot to edit the value count which is still 'aws' count so you said 'surprisingly data are the same.' :D . Needless to say , your whole video is Great. :D"
3757,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Hi Ken. Really it was a great video on the data cleaning process. as a data science beginner i was really finding the data cleaning part extremely irritating when it tried it on some of the beginner projects that you have recommended. but after watching this video it would certainly help me a lot to practice more on data cleaning process.
3758,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Thank you for this amazing content! At 37:50, you looked at the value counts for aws not Excel. Line 58 says 'df.aws.value_counts()' when it should say 'df.excel.value_counts()'"
3759,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),i can't understand how you removed glassdoor est. with just split('(')[0]). I'm confused. please explain bro.
3760,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"I love your commitment towards teaching 
replying and liking each and every comment is not so easy 
but that's what making you special 
keep growing and keep sharing knowledge 
I hope one day you will reach your expectations 
thank you alooootttt"
3761,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hello Ken, I was able to scrape 1000 jobs from glassdoor but I noticed all the salary estimates are the same (58-90k). Please what could be wrong?"
3762,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"First went through a couple of minutes of the video where you discussed what had to be done and started solving it by my own. Once I was done, came back here to check out how you'd solved. This was immensely helpful as my code was not as efficient, and learnt better approaches to the same problem! Thanks Ken!"
3763,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),values_count you used for excel is 'aws' copy and paste/editing error (37:40) I think you meant to say df.excel.values_count( ). Otherwise lambda made simple here. Please could  you do videos on lambda? Otherwise great video as always. so much to pick up Thank you!
3764,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),impressive work so much to learn thanks for doing this Ken keep up the hard work!
3765,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hi Ken... This is really very informative, for me as a newbie in DS. Glad to see that as comfortable as you are using the lambda instead of RegEx with this one to clean up data, yet had to google how to drop a column. :)  I thought that was very cool that you didn't edit it out and makes me feel better. Very encouraging... keep up! Thanks a lot for sharing."
3766,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Been following this channel since I got let go after COVID 19 budget cuts, but figured I'd try to turn something bad into a good opportunity and use this time to learn data science, but this series is awesome coz it really ties in all the theoretical pieces from the coursework together. thank you! Around 26:15, Ken u said we didn't specify a series and we have to let the dataframe know we're doing this on rows....- I don't get this, what does axis = 1 do??"
3767,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),These videos are incredibly helpful man. Thanks a ton from an inspiring data scientist!!!!!!!
3768,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hi Ken, I've been following your work quite some time now. The way you keep your online presence is inspirational. I would love it if you have more step-by-step project videos on Youtube. There are so many areas in which I don't even know if analytics are applied. Sport analytics is interesting for me for example. Also, projects with more practical implications like the regular churn model or HR analytics would add value to your channel, too. I would enjoy watching them on my end at least."
3769,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Just a piece of suggestion on selecting keywords from job description, use ""for loop"" will make it better organized and easier to add new keywords, and the new added columns will always have the same suffix ""_yn"", to avoid unnecessary inconsistencies.

skills = ['python','sql','excel','aws','spark','nlp','rstudio']
for skill in skills:
    df[skill + '_yn'] = df['Job Description'].apply(lambda x: 1 if skill in x.lower() else 0)"
3770,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Thank you for the work Ken, the idea of showing everything step by step is very helpful for beginners. It's boring indeed but no one can get stuff done without the boring phase. I really like the IDE you are using here, with a variable window on the top right, very easy to click on and check out each new variable created, is this Spyder? I am using Pycharm and Jupyter notebook, and didn't find similar features from them, do you know if there is a way in Jupyter notebook to show table contents in a separate window? right now I just use ""df.head()"" to check, thank you so much."
3771,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Thank you. the tutorials are very crisp and interesting. Favorite series for sure.
3772,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Excelent video!!
3773,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"hey ken! i hope you are fine. stay home, stay safe. i would like to give suggestions to
make videos on
1)-data visualiztion
2)- real time projects of data science 
3)- contest going on kaggle and teach how to solve them.
4)- just do not stop making these wonderful videos on data science, it is very helpful for newbie in data science. 

All the best!!"
3774,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),I also love the background music. Can you tell me where can I find it?
3775,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Thank you for your playlist! It's really helpful
3776,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Yeah, this series is super useful for beginners like me. Thanks for making this."
3777,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"I really like this series and I really learned a lot. I am also reaching out to you for a project Idea, I am a data engineer. Please help me"
3778,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),A good series explaining the data science process which a lot of videos and articles ignore. This video in particular would be the time to mention using existing and/or creating a codebook for the dataset.
3779,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Fist of all, thank you for your time making this series. 
It casted a lot of light to me on the big scheme of things in a  project (how you handle it as a whole) Most resources deal just with certain parts so they miss the big picture.

I'm having a hard time...  
I'm trying to get ready a data set (cleaning, inputing, binning, etc)... i wrote individual functions that take the full dataframe as input and outputs it with the respective transformation/inputation/...
Resources mention that is good practice to write functions... So i did... Then i stumble across custom transformers, now I'm trying to create one to use it rather than the individual functions


What is the difference between using lambda funcitons( like in here) and creating the custom transfomers?

Is it good to write one transformer that will deal with all the steps (cleaning, custom value inputing, changing types of values, discretizing, aggregating categories, etc, etc)  to get my dataset ready?
Or what am i supposed to do?
Then i would like to use it in a pipeline to finish with encoding and scaling...

I'm kinda lost and can't find any good resource to solve this...

Thank so much you and keep the good work!"
3780,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Thank you so much Ken. It is very helpful.
3781,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"If anyone getting error at 21:55 when Ken tries to convert it into int.
I tried this method and it worked for me:
df['min salary'] = pd.to_numeric(df['min salary'], errors='coerce')
df['max salary'] = pd.to_numeric(df['max salary'], errors='coerce')
df['min salary'] = df['min salary'].fillna(0).astype('int64')
df['max salary'] = df['max salary'].fillna(0).astype('int64')
After This Data Type Will be Changed From Object to int64.
You can also check  Data Types of every single Column in your DataSet using
df.info()
Or
df.dtypes
In Jupyter NoteBook"
3782,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Very good tutorial. I love the way you explain things. It's easy to understand! ^_^
3783,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"If we follow all these videos step-by-step, could this count as a project to put on a resume or LinkedIn?"
3784,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"appreciated for your  excellent and exceptional work! As a suggestion the videos are a bit long it would be much better if you split them into like scraping data, data cleaning, etc. Hard to see some of the codes on big screen maybe consider using Jupyter Notebook or changing the font or background colour Thank you for your all hard work!"
3785,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Great series. I'm trying it out after looking at your video. I feel that the per hour salary is just for an hour. While you have replaced the per hour with a blank. Aren't we gonna convert the per hour to the actual salary. By googling I found out that a data scientist in the US works almost 60 hours. Shouldn't we multiply this with the per hour salary and then with 52?
3786,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Is it possible to see the data frame as you are in the top right corner (similar to how it's presented in R) in PyCharm or is this view specific to your IDE?
3787,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),This series is exactly what I wanted and I highly recommend to anyone who is entering in Data Science.
3788,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hi Ken, what is your opinion of writing Unit test to make sure your data cleaning is done correctly? It is hard to find a mistake when you have thousands of rows. But you can find mistakes better if you data set is small and controlled."
3789,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"I used to Hate Lambda function , but really I got  good understanding from this Video ,
Thank you so Much"
3790,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Was nice to see near the end of the video that even you too had to look something up! Further backed up your video saying that no real data scientist memorizes everything. We appreciate you for all that your doing!
3791,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hi Ken! I am an italian master's degree student in computer science, and this kind of videos are pure gold! I have a question: since I'm currently attending classes, are there ways to work on projects of this type, let's say ""freelance""?
I would like to start making a bit of money but without affecting the lessons, thanks!"
3792,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hi Ken. When you did the search for excel, you forgot to change df.aws to df.excel which is why you got the exact same count."
3793,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"I tried using lambda functions the way u are using to mark as 1 if data have 'developer' But i am getting error.
TypeError: argument of type 'float' is not iterable
a['developer']=a['MainBranch'].apply(lambda x : 1 if 'developer' in x else 0)
Main branch contains statements something like below
Ex : I am a developer by profession , I am student, I am working as a hobby.


Please let me know what mistake I am doing."
3794,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hi Ken. Thank you so much for this series. This series is such a huge boost for people like me who are trying to learn data science on their own. I have a question regarding the data cleaning. In the video, you manually scrolled through the data to find odd values such as 'per hour', 'employer provided salary' etc. in the Salary Estimate column. But how would you find that kind of value when the data frame has hundreds of thousands or millions of rows? Is there any function or way to find those odd data without manually scrolling or searching?"
3795,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Excellent work, Ken. Your 'soup to nuts' approach is extremely helpful to those like me who are brand new to data science. On top of everything, I like how you show us your use of Git and GitHub as well as all of the lambda functions. Keep it up!"
3796,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"I still don't have enough experience in using python but am amazed in all the ""magic' that it can do! Great job, Ken! You're amazing! :)"
3797,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"In my case , i change three line of code in glassdoor_scraper.py:

3800,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Thanks a lot for your well-detailed videos! Massive help.
3801,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Hey ken the reason why excel has the same count as aws is because after you did the lamda for excel you didn’t replace aws to excel to count
3802,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Great work man! Thanks a lot
3803,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Hey Ken,
Is it just me that I'm unable to see the salary component on the left-aligned job summary columns. I'm able to see only 1. Company Name, 2. Job Title, 3. Location. Is the Salary estimate not visible on the updated Glassdoor page?
I got '-1' as salary estimate for all jobs. And this is the same URL from Omer Sakariya's code.
URL = https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Job/san-francisco-data-scientist-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,13_IC1147401_KO14,28.htm?locKeyword=San%20Francisco,%20CA&seniorityType=all&applicationType=0&locT=C&remoteWorkType=0&fromAge=-1&minRating=0.0&minSalary=0&cityId=-1&employerSizes=0&industryId=-1&companyId=-1&sc.keyword=data+scientist&includeNoSalaryJobs=true&jobType=all&radius=100&locId=1147401&sgocId=-1&countryRedirect=true 

From the ""Part 2"" tutorial, the salary estimate was available in the short summarized segment of the Glassdoor pages.
Now the 'Salary' is visible at the different experience levels (Trainee/ Junior/ Senior roles) which becomes tedious to extract and clean."
3804,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),Awesome video. Is this project resume worthy?
3805,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),"Great examples! I really like the content you are providing 👌🏻 but I’m wondering, how much of the statistics you learned while studying are you applying on a regular basis?"
3806,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),these have been enormously helpful. i've been watching a lot of videos not necessarily acting just yet. btw when the weather gets warmer are you going to be wearing tank tops in your vids?

3842,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,Could you please make a video for master thesis in data science. As a masters student in my final semester I am struggling to find a topic. I got some idea how to go about but it would be great if you dedicate a video and also please explain  some of the areas for research.
3843,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,What projects do you recommend Data Analysts to do? & is there a website I can use to build these projects?
3844,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"Thank yoy for the very informative videos.
I would add the following advice, which I wish someone had told me: while following courses or reading books in the Data Science learning process, we will be doing tiny projects. There will be a tendency to focus on the learning and not on the packaging of one's work. By packaging I mean: cleaning your code, properly commenting it, basically making it into a notebook you could publish, not into a code that just does the job.

So, there is a tendency to produce drafts for these projects in the learning process, instead of final versions. And the assumption is that at that moment learing is the goal, and that at some later moment we will convert these into final portfolio projects, when we have more time that we can spare and dedicate to the cosmetics part. 

But then you end up a few of months later with a lot of small project drafts to finalize and the task of refactoring and documenting so many projects will seem daunting and you'll keep postponing it. 

Therefore, my advice is: dedicate some time during this learning process to finalizing and publishing your work, resist the temptation of pushing this task further into the future. There won't be a 'right' time."
3845,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"Hello,
I am from India and i am currently in class 12th. Now i have this very big doubt on weather i should take B.Tec in CSE or AI. I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD. What my parents thinks that i should take CSE for B.Tec, coz if i don't like AI then i would not be left with more options, and what my side is, that i just love AI, like i literally love it. So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec. So i have this confusion of what to do in my B.Tec, can you please help me through this. It would be really a great help to me. 
My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it's a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?"
3846,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"Very useful video Ken, thanks for taking the time to create it"

3850,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,11:49 wow I literally just learned how to do this for one of my old projects.
3851,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"Hi Ken! First of all thank you for all the great videos that you are making. I just discovered your channel and I really appreciate it.
As I have no internship or education directly link to programming I would like to create a Github page to show to the company that I'm still competent. I'm looking for a job as data analyst in the oil and gas area. Do you have some ideas about projects that I could do? Thank you in advance!"
3852,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,It’s so hard to do a project out of new idea 💡 feel like just quitting this field 10minths and still a noob in this field kills me from inside makes me wanna pull my hair Everytime I see a blank Jupiter notebook

3856,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,You said Everything 🤣
3857,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"Hi Ken, you recommended having some sort of data collection element involved in our projects but how would you show that? Other than including the datasets in your project files & explaining in a writeup, is there any way to show people what your data collection process is?

Also, would you be able to make a video on working with big data / hadoop sometime in the future (if that's something you've had experience with)?"
3858,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,Thanks a lot Ken! Can you please make a video on what software and programming skills are essential for a data scientist job? I am currently learning deeplearning in python. But I am still pretty weak in data visualization and plotting. What should I learn for data visualization? Which libraries in python or what other softwares should I learn to use?
3859,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,Sounds like clustering models (unsupervised) can be used to design database tables
3860,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"Great video, thank you, but these sound more like strictly machine learning than data science tbh"
3861,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"Thanks very useful video,  may i know for the person who is not from the IT background and if they want to start which software they should learn or in more demand, Salesforce, Tableau, QlikView or POWER-BI?

I am very good in excelsheet and i like to find the correlation between two events or things. If you dont mind may i know from where should i start?"

3886,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"Great video sir! For starters, it would be interesting for you to start posting videos on the specifics as you do the projects. That means, ‘learn by doing’. Most of the content out there is platitude and generalistic. Would be interesting if you started doing that."
3887,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,Thanks Ken.
3888,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,Thanks for watching everyone! I would love to hear about the projects you are working on in the comments section below!
3889,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"Hey Ken, great video ;)
So I have done a project where ive scrapped data from a website, performed EDA and built a classifier analysing the performance of various ML model. How exactly do you suggest mentioning this on my resume? Like can you give me an example on how to go about writing it?
Thanks"
3890,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,Great video..... I want to do a project related to financial institution could you please recommend any?
3891,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,how long did it take u to make ur own website
3892,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"Hi Ken, 


Thank you for your advice! This has been very helpful as an aspiring data scientist. I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on this project I am currently working on and if it is good enough to put on my portfolio. To quickly summarize, I did EDA on my Spotify listening history and merged it with a Spotify features dataset that listed features of each song (For example, tempo, major, acousticness, and valence are a couple examples). I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the songs I usually listen to and the features. However, there was very little correlation so I said that the model (using multiple linear regression) I would build would be very inaccurate at predicting, and showed the inaccuracy by building it and finding its mean squared error (which was very large; although there were some predictions that were close). 


In your opinion, would this suffice as a good project? If not, do you have any insight on how I could improve? 


Thank you for all your videos!"
3893,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,Can you please suggest some tutorials for learning deployment of Machine learning models
3894,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"Great advice bro, had to give it a like and subscribed"
3895,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"You spent almost half of your presentation talking about Machine learning(feature engineering, clustering, regression etc). In my humble opinion Data science has a lot to do with other aspects other than Machine learning. I realized many people focus a lot on machine learning which shrinks a lot of the aspects of data science. Kaggle, for example, encourages folks to hone their machine learning skills. Kaggle isn't a good place to learn full fledge data science skills. Data collection,  Data Cleaning, Data manipulation, Exploratory Data analyses where all left out. Kaggle mostly brings ready-made datasets which limits many kagglers the ability to effectively develop their data science skills. Nevertheless I sincerely appreciate the value you have provided through your video. Thank you"
3896,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"As soon as I saw that there are no ads, I subscribed."
3897,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"Same like as this channel if you any one of you want to do data science projects and M.L and A.I projects please refer to this M.I.T student channel and i am not promoting, But those who are interested get to this data science Channel for projects and about latest technologies

3899,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"Hi Ken, loving the channel! I’m likely going to try and push into data science once my PhD is complete and I was wondering how big should a project be to make it worthy of going on a resume? I imagine something written in a few hours wouldn’t be worthy but where exactly this line falls I’m not so sure?"

3905,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,Ken please make tutorials video on specific Data Science projects....it would be helpful
3906,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"That last part of your video was top tier. For my capstone project in college, I had did a semester long data science project that had a ton of different parts. We collected our own data, cleaned it, and created new features out of existing ones. We didn’t have enough time to create a website or proper interface to interact with our results, but putting in that extra work is really what made the project stand out."
3907,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"What's the ""fla..scraper"" thing you mentioned to automate the scraping? Loved the video <3"
3908,The Projects You Should Do To Get A Data Science Job,"This is great. I've always wanted to go into data science, but I keep hearing the whole ""Go to college"" deal, and honestly, I can't do it now (I did college and that was a failure)."

3952,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,I still consider myself a beginner after almost two years of learning. Listen to what he says. He is spot on! I would also add that if TOUS start a MOOC make sure you finish it unless the content seems to advanced for your current level
3953,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Bravo, Ken. You´ve certainly figured out a lot of this right. Thanks for sharing!"
3954,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Hands-on projects, especially small, focused projects, from the outset will accelerate learning of both the theoretical concepts and the practical skills. For example, learn Python while learning a data acquisition technique provides context and motivation. This approach applies to each stage of the data science workflow and to each of the technologies. Revisit earlier projects and add another stage of the workflow."

3977,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"100% agree on getting your hands dirty early with projects!

When I started, I tried various courses and MOOC's but nothing ever stuck. The moment I started attempting my own projects I started to see progress in my learning and I finally started to retain the information I was learning :)"
3978,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Hey Ken just wanted to take the moment to congratulate you for how far you've come. I remember when you were a bit more underground which is just so crazy to think about. I'm super glad to have experienced your growth as your content continues to help me along my own journey, be it about data science/analytics or your philosophies. Anyways, looking forward to more awesome videos and can't wait to someday make it on your podcast!"
3979,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,You focus on about DS only u should say something about the person's environment about DS is also affect more than DS itself
3980,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Thank you Ken for sharing your genuine thoughts on this topic. Not gonna lie, I find myself doing some of them too"
3981,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"I think #3 is person dependent. If you become to reliant on a coach/mentor then your problem is your mentor not coaching you to become a more self-sustainable data scientist. I'd have killed for a bit more guidance in my formative career years rather than go and try lots of solutions. 

Maybe it's person dependent? Either way, great video. Liked and subscribed!"
3982,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Thank you Ken ! The fire of obsession and stuck time are strongly correlated negatively for me, but as soon as I take a break and get my ... together I find success in the end. I used to wonder if I really love the field, but after listening to you in this video, I realized that feeling this way should be quite common. I would also add that a big mistake for DS beginners is not watching Ken and Tina's videos :) .. You guys give us all we need to stay on track"
3983,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Unrelated question here!, So Im a junior physics student right now looking to become a data scientist in the future, what is the fastest route to become a data scientist ? Land a data scientist internship, get a data engineering/analyst job, software engineering job, etc? Also I live in San Diego and don't plan on moving is this going to cripple my chances to find work?"
3984,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"HI KEN!! Only two months ago, I started my journey by watching your video(beginner's guide) and today got my  first Internship ❤️ thank you for being my ultimate source of motivation!!!   Btw Happy Ramadan!! ❤️❤️"

3989,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,Apologies for the unrelated comment but what is the brand-model of the chair that you're using at 4:40? Thank you and more power to you.
3990,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"hey man, love your videos :). I know you are very experienced with video editing and data science (obviously), but I believe the audio mixing in your videos is not where it should be. I think you should take the time to learn basic sound and audio mixing (to make your voice more soothing etc.). A good example to learn from is the YT channel ""3blue1brown"", which has great audio mixing.
Good luck with it!"

4000,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"I hope I learned this early on my early years but I'm still 20 so I have more time to start. thanks for your video, it helped me  internalize what you said since Im always burn out before and tried so many stuffs on self dev but the truth is ""I have to be honest with myself"" and have my own system not copying others. I will become data scientist for next 2-3 years :)"
4001,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Rip papaya you have , eat it first you must . hahaha. Nice video. I too believe self evaluation is very important before entering in any field.

4022,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,1:53 Wow USB-powered Papayas? Great insights Ken! Yes totally agree with you on the importance of domain knowledge which also helps to differentiate us from others.
4023,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Hey ken please make a video on interview for data science....like what kind of python coding question will be asked, etc..."
4024,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,Thanks for sharing Ken 👍
4025,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"So, I am not making most of the beginner mistakes.  
But I have one question Ken. I don't know enough. Should i see the projects on YouTube and try to implement them by copying and understanding them? And you told about plagiarism in DS.  Will it be like I plagiarized those projects ??"
4026,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"I'd personally recommend watching some free videos on a topic on yt before enrolling in a course. This way you can easier choose a good course because you already know what to look for, and since you already know some basics as you watched that free stuff, the material sinks in better because you are repeating it again while watching the course you chose (plus you get a different angle on the topic). 

As you say and I can confirm (from a PhD perspective) ;) getting more then one point of view is important. People have a bias and some things are obvious for one person while difficult for another, the choice of words is very important too. 

Mine main problem is I like theory too much plus I tend to start too many topics at once. I get too impatient and can start NLP topics even though I should be doing e.g. clustering, and NLP is not on the plan for the next few months at least. This has some advantages too (not only bad sides!) - when I get to NLP it's not all new and sinks in better, but me doing that makes the whole process chaotic. Well, I try to pat myself on the back that - in the end - if I fill all the knowledge gaps - it's not that important in what order I did it... 

Still I know I need more order and systematic approach. And more practice. 

Other issue with learning DS, or every new thing really, is that you don't know how long it will take you (coz it's new to you and you don't know it so how can you plan how long it will take if you don't even know what are all the things you must learn... if it makes any sense). So - yeah, don't get crazy about deadlines, just focus on the progress.

Another pro-tip - browse job offers to see what the companies want. I think this may be area and industry specific - in my area they want people good with databases, Hadoop, Spark and other Big data associated things more then they want Deep Learning & AI specialists. 

Kinda makes sense when you think of it... So for me, on my road to Data Science, I decided to go back to my analytics job that will let me practice python&SQL more, get my bills payed ;) and practice the DS stuff in my free time (coz I can already see with the Big data things and me still needing to work on my DL skills more this can easily take another 6 months...) 

So yeah, some comments on Data Science learning from someone who has been learning it for about 6 months ;)"
4027,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"The most refreshing thing about your videos is the honesty.  Almost as much as the advise. 

That and seeing your dad make Cameos 🤣"
4028,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Yeah, The community helped me to create the learning habit. Thank you so much, Ken."
4029,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Great video as always, Ken! & definitely the right choice :D @1:28"
4030,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Hey Ken, have you ever thought on making a video on what is important when you are in a data science role already. Would be quite interesting for me to hear your opinion. I sometimes do not know if I should dive VERY deep into some specific topics or just use my freetime to learn something somewhat related. For example I love working with REST Apis and even some Vue Frontend stuff which will not make me a better data scientist, but are also fun... Since I am also a content creator I something think the same way about creating videos. What´s your opinion?"
4031,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,Is a masters needed because I am very tired of school?😂
4032,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,Mistake nr 8 : data leakage between your training and testing sets. I saw that being made by an experienced data scientist in my first job. It was ignored and a 85% precision/recall score was announced to management.
4033,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Hi! I like watching your videos. Love and support from India ♥️ There's some thing in particular that I'd like to ask. 
1) It's been some time since I completed MySQL course. However i have gone through the videos a few times but still I am not able to gain the confidence of saying that I know SQL.  What do you suggest here? 
2) Practical knowledge is very important and I am unable to get that. I have a dataset. I make up problem statements in my mind and try solving it. But that is clearly not helping at all. So can you suggest me some places where I can apply the knowledge of Sql that I gained through the course? 

Course I took: 365 Data Science."
4034,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,Excellent Insights! I totally agree with the point of not applying your knowledge and focusing only on theory as being one of the biggest hurdle for someone new in the field.
4035,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Those are spot on .
These are few of the mistake I made when I was starting"
4036,The 7 Biggest Data Science  Beginner Mistakes,"Mistake I personally made,  I didn't learn enough math. And I thought that I could brute force my way through a data science course with some hodgepodge math. I think really getting that foundation is pretty important and it can be done in a singular course, it doesn't have to be a year of university math classes"

4042,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Thanks for this video Ken.

I decided to go into Tech in 2018 by learning web development. Learnt a bit of HTML, CSS and Javascript. My goals has since evolved through this period as I got interested in python programming and Data science.

My current interest now tends towards deep learning and AI

Interesting my knowledge of front end web development will be very helpful in web scraping."
4043,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Hello ken jee!!! I'm doing a graduation on Computer Science and i really keen to learn Data Science. From where should i start? learning Python basics? If you have any resources of learning Python, could you help me providing the link? To be honest my excitement to learning data science get on the top notch after watching your this video. 😄"
4044,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Great video!!! I started learning Python 8 months ago and quickly became interested in DS, I have a background in Finace/Econ but never worked in finance (I have a construction business), my goal is to learn DS and work with investments. Having said all that im considering a boot camp and even a masters in DS, I would love to get your opinion on that. Thanks"

4046,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),thank you for the high quality videos
4047,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),Is it realisable to apply deep learning on a real project after four months starting from scratch in this field ?
4048,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"great video, thanks for advice!"
4049,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"How about don't learn data science lol. I'm sorry but the only benefit is that it pays REALLY well. It lacks creativity, is stressful because of the pressure that corporations put on your utilitarian ""skills"" you bring to the table to asses and translate data. Its a hard job. I'd pass."
4050,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),What about PySpark? Does it also make sense to pay attention to it? And what could be a possible private project example?

So is it possible that if I  start learning data science from scratch (which i am doing right now) and then get a job in data science field before completing my bachelor's degree in cse?
second question is can I apply for a master's degree on data science or related field while doing my bachelor's degree?
Thanks in advance"
4055,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),First time to your channel Great advice thank you. I am going to start with all the points you said..  Right video at the right time :)
4056,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Thank you for all the information that you share. I've spent several months considering the proper career switch after deciding not to return to medical school. At this point, I'm confident that data science is the proper career path. My overarching goal is to use data science in healthcare, but I am open to other fields. I found your channel today, and I want to say I am already grateful for your content and the resources you share. In addition to this video, I watched a video this evening in which you mentioned that Jan 4 is your bday. Happy Belated Birthday. May you continue to experience joy and success."
4057,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Watching it again and starting to think if my struggling to learn python and pandas as well itnis not impatiance? Yes, at little."
4058,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"This video is extremely accurate. I have had such a hard time learning how to be a data scientist. I am in a MS in Data Analytics program and feel that doesn't really provide any real direction. I don't know what I don't know and that keeps me from learning what I need to know. Seeing the path helps, thank you. I would like to say I have struggled to learn R and I seem to be getting SQL quickly and I think this will help my confidence. Getting one language down can help to learn another, just from a confidence standpoint."
4059,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Hi Ken, thank you for your videos. I have a question, I am software developer with 8 years experience. Mostly Web, PHP, SQL, GO, I decided to start learning machine learning, here is a lot of Python and so on, what do you think if person like me, firstly, will change position to data analyst and continue to learn ML ? Is it right decision ? Thank you."

4061,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),What are your thoughts on Datacamp?
4062,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"I am learning how to build predictive models by watching videos and working alongside on another screen.  It's really satisfying to see your code work.  Especially when you start to experiment with your own parameters.  Why do you think Python is more important to learn than R?  Is it more versatile? I'm learning both, I'm just curious what you think."
4063,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Hey, I have started my journey on learning data science. And, the math is what I find the most overwhelming, so much that I almost dropped the idea but curiosity gets the better of me and keeps on track. Being from non CS background, I feel really lost and tired when it comes to mathematics involved. 

Could you please share the maths topics and their sub topics that I should focus on and get as proefficient in it. I will be absolutely grateful if you get a chance to share the same and if any resources that I should refer to."
4064,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Hi Ken, how are you? Hope fine.
So, I am returning to college this year. I am going back to computer science. I am studying Java because of that.
And because I was struggling to learn python, my godness! I try every possible way, then I turn out to python official documentation. I achieve a more cleary glimpse of what is python, but nothing too much practical. I found a guy, corey schaffer, he is really didatic. 
My goal, for this month, is start a small data science project for a local market here where I live. I already have SQL, MySQL, AWS basics and a solid background in maths and stathistics. I think i can do it. If don't, the lesson will be learned. You know.
So, thank you for your advice."
4065,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"You earned new subscriber. Love your encouragement for people like me. I did installed Python last year but stuck on where to start cuz I dunno what specific purpose. Since I wanna do my PhD related to AI (predictive model), should I learn the whole coding of python or only focus related to AI coding?"
4066,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"As I learnt python. I was working on projects from kaggle with a  problem Statement. I was searching different data exploration techniques.
You explained it clearly I love the way you teach.
I am following you learning strategie.
Thank you"
4067,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),Good video.
4068,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Thanks Ken, I took off with python basis last two years, within the space of 2 months, I was already in Pandas, and doing the Jupyter thing. Anyways everything poured on my face, and I just gave up. With this video I saw my mistakes. Roadmap. Starting with the basis and mastering them. Then you proceed. Spend as much time as you want to learn the basis. When your is strong, your building will last forever. Thanks again Ken.

To anyone reading this, if you're looking to break into Data Science in 2022 I 100% recommend subscribing to Ken's channel and following his advice!!

Back when COVID-19 started in 2020, I was looking to break into the field and I had no experience, no projects, and I didn't know where to start.

6 MONTHS after subscribing to Ken's channel and soaking in all of his advice through his videos, I got a job as a Data analyst.

I'm living proof that this channel is 100% all that you need to get started. Thank you Ken and & I can't thank you enough for the doors you have opened for me."
4084,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),The only question I got is do we need a traditional degree to get in that domain? I'm a finance grad. Idk if I'd be eligible for a masters program in data science so how do I do it? Cause I don't think employers recognise anything other than degrees.
4085,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),Do you need a masters degree?? Cos it seems a lot of people are running to data science and AI masters programs

4090,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Thanks, Ken. I have started learning myself Data Science, fortunately, I have a programming/math background. and so far I have found the going reasonable all though it is an effort in time. My question is this is there a place for a part-time / freelance Data Scientist? I find the field extremely interesting but I doubt if that is all I want to do. Also, do you know if c++ is still used in Data Science? Kind regards"
4091,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Watched just right now, but worth it.
I want to entry in data science because I like to solve problems driven by data. I like to see the variables of a problem in the reality and reach a solution; solve real-world problems. This is something that I couldn't do with enginnering; college was a really frustation. But there I heard of 'data science' for the very first time and learn stathistics.
I trying to enter in this field in a self paced manner. Already study python documentation, trying pandas documentation. Anyway... I hope the year ahead will be better."
4092,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),Great video Ken!  I will be sharing with my incoming students this semester!

4094,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"I used your project-based learning approach from last year's video to learn data science. After 15 months and 700 hours of learning (no online courses, just individual studying), I landed as job as a mid-level data scientist in financial fraud detection. Thank you! This video is spot-on. Especially your emphasis of building a roadmap and systematically updating it as you grow.

2 not-obvious study habits which I found helpful:
1. I kept multiple projects open so that after I went through a topic (e.g. feature selection), I could implement it in multiple projects.
2. For each topic in my roadmap, I kept a date of when I last implemented the technique in a project. This helped me identify important topics which I had covered a while ago and might have partially forgotten, so that I could refresh my knowledge/skills."

4101,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Data science is a vast field and as ken said if we consider learning data science process as a journey we will enjoy the whole process rather than getting overwhelmed by it.
1) Set goal for your self (I want to get good understanding of deep learning)
2) Stick to it.
3) Do as many projects as you want.
4) Showcase your project so that world know what you are doing (you should be open for any kind of criticism or feedback)
5) Repeat step number 3 for the rest of the 2022."

4122,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Great advice on typing out other people's work. Myself as a beginner it's easy to get flustered on projects as some solutions/tools I have not yet been exposed to. By looking up other's solutions/work and typing them out it really helps me to understand the anatomy of the code. Furthermore, sometimes the solutions don't work as I am using python 3.10 and so I have to work out and start fishing around for the latest 'iteration' of the module/code and that actually helps to drive home the knowledge."
4123,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Thanks for the insights ken, do you think cloud computing skills (AWS, azure etc..) is necessary for the data science journey."

4125,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Ken, what I have found is all these online projects / learnings mostly gives 10 variables and ask to predict a 11th one. But in the real world it’s very difficult to goto that level of identifying a problem and later identifying a approach to solver a problem . Until now I have not seen any course teaching that. Your advice on this ?"
4126,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),Do you have a Udemy course?
4127,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"Thanks a lot, some of us have only just started using python properly the last few months and videos like this are very useful"
4128,How I Would Learn Data Science in 2022 (If I Had to Start Over),"""When beginning with this projects, they don't have to be original. You can go through the exact same analysis that someone else did, and still learn something. But typical learning session could just be you having someone else's project on half the screen and you typing it line-by-line and running it on other half of the screen. As you do this you can change the parameters, you can  experiment with different visuals and see how it works as you go.""

This one what i've been thinking for. i feel like i do nothing if i see someone's project and copy it to my notebook, but you just said it and i totally agree. we can experiment it with changing the code, maybe we use a different way to clean the data, or just define a function that others use repeated code, (a.k.a use DRY concept), and so on.

thanks Ken Jee, it really helps me out."

What can I pursue if i really hate coding? Note: I got 98/100 in Java in academic course. But I don't like now. Sports analytics intrigued me because it showed me direct application of what I have learnt in my academics...and I am afraid to get into data analytics/science just because it has coding?

4186,How YOU Can Land a Sports Analytics Job,You know what I hate about modern day sports analytics? You got all these terms that never existed like 10 or so years ago in sports with strange names that are hard to figure out what they even mean. Yet people continuously write articles referencing them as if the average sports fan already knows what all these are and they're self explanatory even though they clearly aren't and it's fancy jargon that you have no clue what it could possibly mean. Like I was reading an article talking about Breonna Stewarts win shares in her WNBA career. Nowhere in the article did it explain what win shares mean. Obviously it has to do with wins. But beyond that I have no clue. Then there is this other one that has defense or defensive in the title I can remember the full name of the stat but it's a really strange name. It's mentioned all the time as if it's common sense to what it means and we should already know. Lol. Nobody ever explains these things as if they're normal stats. Lol.

I have a technical background but my specialization is Mechanical. Also like every second Indian boy I follow and play cricket alot , I came across your video and gave a thought to explore in this field. Also while pursuing this career I think that choosing your favourite sport would be a good idea. So as I mentioned without having any prior experience in the skillsets, how can I prepare a roadmap for becoming a cricket performance analyst?

Do you think it is a waste of time considering that my mathematical education is that of the institute? Thanks again."
4211,How YOU Can Land a Sports Analytics Job,I've heard that a great way to eventually end up in a sports position is to work in data for a non-sports business first to legitimize yourself and then transition to sports. Have you seen this and would you recommend?
4212,How YOU Can Land a Sports Analytics Job,"Thanks for this video ! Very very helpful. I have 8 years of experience working in bioinformatics and dealing with big data from genomics and genetics. I have been looking into transitioning to sports analytics as a new career option . I do have basic data science skills from my bioinformatics work experience but I don't have any specific projects I have done independently in the sports domain. Do you think it would be useful for me to pursue a sports analytics degree before I start looking for opportunities in this domain ? Or would the sports industry still consider me as an eligible candidate based on my programming/machine learning experience while handling big data in the biology domain, even if I don't have real-world experience in sports ?  I do follow several sports enthusiastically such as football, soccer and basketball and I am aware of all the terminologies associated with these sports. I'd really appreciate your feedback. Thanks !"

4221,How YOU Can Land a Sports Analytics Job,I love data science but I don't really care about sports analytics.  What other areas or niches could be interesting?
4222,How YOU Can Land a Sports Analytics Job,This video helped a bunch! I’m a high school senior who is torn between my major for next year. I’m deciding between music and sports business/marketing. I’m pretty well versed with how the sports world works due to just falling in love with sports in general. Is there any chance I could get your email? I would love to be able to chat about this field!
4223,How YOU Can Land a Sports Analytics Job,"In really interested in sports analytics or data science as a field. I am only in high school, so what majors would be good to pursue this kind of job? Would you suggest something like statistics or computer science?"
4224,How YOU Can Land a Sports Analytics Job,Thank you. I work as Marketing Data Analytics. Want to switch to sports analytics.
4225,How YOU Can Land a Sports Analytics Job,"Hello Ken, thank you for everything you are making on YouTube. It has been extremely helpful.  I was wondering, could you go more in-depth into what data scientists for NBA teams are currently working on? I have trouble knowing what projects could create value because clubs seem to protect all of their in-house work."
4226,How YOU Can Land a Sports Analytics Job,"Thank you! Could you be my mentor in Data Analysis field? I would like to communicate with you via stophyuni@gmail.com if you don,t mind. I hope you to send me an email if possible."
4227,How YOU Can Land a Sports Analytics Job,"Would love to see more videos about sports analytics, specifically in detail basketball(nba), this was very helpful"
4228,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Hey Ken! I was wondering what you think about many people using a single account on Netflix or Amazon prime video? It must impact the recommendation generated for that account but also affect user-user similarity used for recommendations.
4229,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I hope you see my comment… I’m tired. I just can’t grasp the logistics of R. Even in college Coding just doesn’t stick in my head. Actuarial science….calculus…financial mathematics… that’s my thing. Apparently, because people are jumping on the Data Science bandwagon they’re subsequently helping increase the demand for physical Mathematicians. The money is nice. You are absolutely correct, it does make one feel burned out. I suggest anyone who has children put them in classes NOW it doesn’t matter if they are 5-10 do it. However there will always be a need for applied Mathematics"
4230,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Having learnt c++ and c#, i studied python in a week, it was so easy it was starting to demoralize me.... i find web scraping really cool, because i wanna do it for personal interests, maybe trading, i still dont know"
4231,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,When are we not in ANYTHING for the money?
4232,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Hello
I am above 50 years old - I have Master degrees in Business Administration and Statistics . I have also done  programming at the initial stage of my career and had been working in the ICT area. Recently I have acquired knowledge of ML with Python. I wonder why I didnt think about being a data scientist earlier ! Anyway I want to be one one now - almost at the fang end of my career.. I have worked in the Middle East and India and in the UK for only 1 year after MBA. 
I am a very fast learner .
Can anyone help me in getting data scientist or analyst or business analyst job anywhere in the world? I know my age maybe a negative point but then I have vast experience of working in different business area."
4233,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Addicted to this channel. ❤️
4234,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,What if you have a strong dislike for math?
4235,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I'm so happy that YouTube recommended me this channel. I noticed that being a data scientist was my childhood dream it is just that I didn't know the name until now. I just used to say ""I'm going to be a researcher"". Thank you for all the thought you put on your videos!"
4236,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Can't tell you how bored I am these days. If I've succeeded autonomy in my kitchen as the room chef, I literally am bored out of my mind. There's nothing to solve, there's nothing to improve on. Even if there is, its not happening frequent enough to keep me on my toes. I think, aside from the money, data scientist might be something that would allow me to challenge myself and that's something I'm jumping into."
4237,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Honestly autonomy is the reason I got in but I do get stuck in wrong thinking sometimes
4238,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I thought the field of Data Science was all ""Money for nothing, chicks for free"". Apparently i was wrong. 😁"
4239,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,@Ken Jee So what else can I do? I am definitely in it for the money.
4240,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,In short its bad for introverts
4241,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Did you get a job with undergraduate degree?
Is there a Q&A series with these kind of Qs, please let me know i will look it up."
4242,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,hey some one please put him in jail please
4243,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Thanks for watching! If you decide data science is for you, I recommend these free resources to learn it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip50cXvpWY4&ab_channel=KenJee
Here is the paid resource I recommend if you want more structure: 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY"
4244,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,You forgot uncomfortable with math🤣😁😁🤣
4245,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I was interested in pursuing a career in clinical psychology when halfway through I realized I loved working with the data. Currently a junior in college and a bit stressed because I feel like I'm late to the game, but I am glad that I seemed to have found the right fit from what you said"
4246,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"#54: Oh my! I never tried skiing (not sure if I will... I always think is not safe 😅 and you are giving me the reason he he) 
I do like you being emphatic about the love for DS and what is needed to make it meaningful, like all things in life, require commitment, STUDY, and community! 
#66daysofdata"
4247,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,nice click bait
4248,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I appreciate your thoughts! 
Well made video. Also ..What do you think about the future of Data Science, analytics , Machine Learning  ?
AI is rising and automation will surely hit this field some are even saying Data Scientists will be outdated and automated by 2025-2030... as AI and AutoML like emerging technologies  analyse data more efficiently and faster..
I am in no way discouraging anyone its just that these things are being heard often nowadays..Also which UG will be better Economics or Computer science in the long run ! 
I need your perspective :)"
4249,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Get a mic bro
4250,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Personally, it's because it's something I've always been into and as a marketer and content producer, It's a skill that would enlighten and facilitate our job and my businesses."
4251,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"In short the reasons (from description):
#datascience
1) You are in it for the money
2) You don't like autonomy 
3) You are uncomfortable with collaboration"
4252,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,You are a honest guy .. I love it !!!!
4253,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I strongly agree with you about the three rasons in order to not become in a data scientist but I think as you told, depends on your position or your goal. For instance, I think in the resarch area you have less collaboration because most time you are the only one that know your work or your novel investigation so it's sometimes hard to display this to others.  I think there are many resources for learning data science hence the main problem to become in data scientist is the patience and self-confidence."
4254,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Hi Ken, I watched many of your vedios and I found very interesting and helpful. I have a doubt with my profile evaluation. Can you help me out please.
I did graduation from civil engineering in top NIT's. After my grad, I was working as a Mathematics faculty for colleges. Will this experience count if I apply for data science masters degree. Thankyou"
4255,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Wonderful. I’m the polar opposite of everything you said
4256,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I think the reason why I would like to get into Data Science is just the outright versatility it can offer in many sectors such as finance,healthcare,IT etc. The whole concept of breaking down and finding solutions is interesting. I started to doing a Python course and I'm really enjoying the coding but I just wanted to ask I come from a Finance background with some banking experience. Can you please give me some tips on what I should do exactly? Thanks!"
4257,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,That's really helpful!!
4258,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,I was thinking of taking data science because it involved coding. But now I'm not so sure about it.
4259,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,i just cant solve kaggle problems should i quit this field its been 10months already
4260,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,3rd point is my biggest hadicap :'(
4261,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Data analytics has a future?
4262,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I like the fact that you made it clear that these aren't inherent skills or character sets, but that they can be learnt!! :)

I would work more on collaboration for personal projects both in Ds and web development"
4263,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Hi! What's the best major to become a data scientist?
4264,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Very informative. Well done. Thank you.
4265,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"thank you Sir, this was informative, indeed!"
4266,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,I think data science is the first career that I've considered where I didn't look up the salary before looking into it more lol
4267,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Money - Check
Need for Autonomy - Check
Creativity - Check
Uncomfortable with Collaboration - Failed (I personally struggle in driving others to deliver)

These are in-sights with great clarity. Thanks a lot.
I got 2/3 in my favour. The 3rd is something we can learn."
4268,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I just graduated with my Bachelors and always thought data science was interesting and that it was the path I was going to aim towards. But recently with the low amount of entry level DS positions available and the overwhelming amount of material to know, I have been debating on changing career paths. I definitely underestimated the level of knowledge and expertise you need in order to be in this field. Watching this video has helped me realize that maybe it isn't the right fit for me. I am personally uncomfortable with autonomy mainly because I haven't had any prior work experience. I definitely have a lot to consider. Thank you for sharing :)"
4269,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Great video. As a woman, I experience pushback even from family members for just being interested in science, let alone math & data. I just decided after a year that THIS is what I want to do.... switching from Agriculture. I told a family member who does something slightly similar to Data Science... and he literally asked me if I am sure it is what I want to do because it is a lot of numbers. 

I am excited about switching majors and going for this‼"
4270,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Due to covid the aus government is sponsoring retraining and data analytics stood out for me. I come from an arts/business major and I'm an English Second Language Teacher. All the work has dried up and I was transitioning to work in film but with restrictions that won't be possible anymore. So I've decided to retrain. I dont know if data science/analytics is right for me because I havent tried it, however I did do well in stats at uni and maths in school. I figure ill give it a go and if i dont like it then what the hell, i only spent $2500 for 6 months of which i wouldn't have worked anyway. Thoughts ? Just researching this has kept me up at night"
4271,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Build a project for next Ryder Cup winner...I'm fact don't need to as it'll be Europe ;) 
enjoyed the video. From Northern Ireland"
4272,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,You speak to slowly
4273,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I started reading about stat 2-3yrs back, also learnt indepth theory for linear, logistic regression etc, did very basic kaggle project. I work in bank. 6 months back i got my first real life banking modelling project. Dara quality is horribly bad. I have seen rather than the process its good engineered feature that improves the model. But what demotivates me after much thought also, my features don't improve model. Also i am not good at finding good insights. They are average. Any tips?"
4274,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,I'll be graduating with a degree in electrical and electronics engineering and I'm looking to do a masters in Data science and business analytics. Would this be a good combo?
4275,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"My major in college is Economics and I want to follow a path in DS, what do you think?"
4276,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Well, I find this motivating <3. Even if I lack the confidence to collab, I can learn that on my way."
4277,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,If I'm ever able to land a data science job it'll be because of you
4278,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Also I am a Full Time commerce student,  I don't do Physical science. Can I still pursue a bcom applied Mathematics degree without knowledge of Physical science, or should I perhaps just go with statistical learning(bcom mathematical sciences)?"
4279,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I am very Interested in Data Science, Not for money, instead I never even thought of That. I'd say I am good at Maths, creative with good presentation skills, and yes I do love helping and working together  with others to solve problems, but I'm not good with computers. Can I learn to do that? Am I taking a risk?"
4280,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Thanks for such great content in a simple, crisp, precise package. I've only watched like 2-3 videos of your channel. 
It's praiseworthy how you deliver precise content without much of visualization in such a simple, no-nonsense manner.
Subscribed and liked for the QUALITY! :) 
I hope you keep getting better and go on more adventurous rides and return without injuries! :P"
4281,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Ur a true inspiration to people who strive to achieve greatness.
4282,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I would learn almost anything for $120k.  I would clean toilets, put stickers on car parts, hold a sign on the side of the road, eat wasabi, whatever.  You can buy a full-sized house after only a couple years of savings with that kind of money.  Most Americans haven't had that standard of living for 50 years.  I only hear rich people say that you shouldn't do x for the money.  It would be more convincing to hear that from somebody who quit a data scientist job to go work at Walmart."
4283,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,I hate collaborating but the reason why I want to take data science is because I want to end up in AI research
4284,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I'm an accouting that wants to become in a DS, do you think this combo works?"
4285,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"How important is it to have a master's degree for getting a job? I'm currently an undergrad CS major with a Stats minor, and I honestly feel like I can learn what I need online without a master's."
4286,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Well, it seems to me that this video is far better than any of all of the other videos on similar topics. Straight to the point, clear, precise in the right way. I just wonder why so few visualizations."
4287,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Do I still have a chance to go for data science if I am not gud at maths
4288,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,What if you aren't best programmers but enjoy and good at stats and maths side of it
4289,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,I think you are good looking
4290,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"1.  you're in it for the Money
2.  you don't like Autonomy
3. you're uncomfortable with
  colaboration.

THANKS ME LATER"
4291,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Get well soon.
4292,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Ken, thank you for your content! I participated in Stanford's 5 week course titled Code in Place and we're now in our final project phase. We spent the past five weeks learning Python. I found your videos through searching ""data science for beginners what is data science"" in efforts of getting ideas for what kind of final project I want to try 😂The 5 week pace of the course was absolutely too fast for me, but I am so glad I found your channel. After this video in particular, this is definitely a path I want to continue learning about (ie what new information can I read by using methods beyond my usual qualitative analysis approach to things), and you've already helped me create a learning path beyond this course. Thank you! I look forward to more content"
4293,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Curious, where'd you get those glasses? lol"
4294,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,There is no shame to be DS for make more money.  When I will make money i will love what I do.
4295,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Im getting interested in programming and have a regular science degree with no background in mathematics.. The idea excites me.. but with no experience in maths its probably too bigger decision for myself :(( maybe ill just stick to Spatial science, we will see"
4296,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,There's not enough content in this video to fill even the 10 seconds in the beginning when you ask everyone to subscribe. Is it just me or YT is a time black hole?
4297,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Good content 👍🏻
4298,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,I am interested in AGI how can I move forward if I choose path of data science (is there any other path)
4299,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"It will be hard for me, i dont like collaborating with people because i dont like arguements"
4300,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Phew! I thought you were going to say ""For the girls.""."
4301,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,He is just saying you can learn anything if you are honest to your work!
4302,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Thanks for this video. I am an ""analyst"" trying to decide if I want to become a data scientist but it seems like some of the things I dislike about my role may be the position and not the company. I'm the only analyst with nobody to ask questions, less prof development opportunities, and nobody knows what I do :( The autonomy/expert thing kills me! I'd much rather have a team and people who understand benefit of my work. Have you experienced being in your own little corner or being way ahead of your companies' resources?"
4303,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Helpful video.
1. Should I go for Data Science if I want to work as a remote employee?
2. Should I go for learning Data Science if I am 35+ years of old having business graduation majoring in MIS (database management system)?"
4304,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Thanks for good advices, I'd like to work in future as a Data Scientist but the essential element for me is having a partner to learn or do something together and I wonder where can I find a group of people to do a project together"
4305,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Hmm, I just found out I don't match any of these. Which in fact makes me consider becoming DS."
4306,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,The autonomy part though
4307,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Hope you are fine now.
4308,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Glad I found your channel. Pretty much gave me a roadmap for getting into the field. I’m an analyst now but would definitely like to do sports data science. Seems like a dream job!
4309,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I don't agree with some of these points, I think if you are the expert of your company then you need to jump into bigger challenges. Nothing worth solving is done by 1 person, you usually work in a team of data scientists, data engineer, machine learning engineers so ask for help when needed (don't over do it obviously) but PLEASE! don't have an ego unless you are Ian Goodfellow and he seems very humble so please don't have an ego."
4310,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,As a Data Scientist myself I totally I agree with everything you just said!
4311,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"I feel like the creativity mindset is SOOO important. I'm currently still looking for my first data science/analytics job, but while on the lookout I'm working on my own projects. It definitely takes a lot of creativity to approach certain problems you want to find an answer to."
4312,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Get well soon Ken!!
4313,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,"Ken, get well soon! Best regards from Russia :)"
4314,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,Hope you get well soon!
4315,How I Learned Data Science,The one video of yours that a few are watching and everyone should watch.
4316,How I Learned Data Science,Thanks my data science professor for teaching me so much always every single day😁
4317,How I Learned Data Science,"Play video at 1.25x, thank me later"
4318,How I Learned Data Science,Did he say he got 2 master degrees? what was the first one? the second one was comp sci...
4319,How I Learned Data Science,"#65: The dog ... okeyyyy 🐶
So statistics, yeap think mathematically is important on DS. 
I get stuck sometimes thinking which is the best way to play with the features. Really STUCK! (Any advice on this?)
It's nice to hear your story, and how the experience vs. interest give you a nice path to DS and ML, and how you share what you learn in this videos. Thank you! :)

Thank you Ken..!"
4324,How I Learned Data Science,Thank you for your video! Very encouraging to start learning ! What do you think about Coursera courses? I am taking python for AI from IBM now to build my python skills
4325,How I Learned Data Science,"The really basics are: Python, SQL, calculus and stathistics?"
4326,How I Learned Data Science,"Hey Keen, i trying to build a better basics in fundamental mathematics: logic, sets, functions. I already have a background in calculus and stathistics, because I was in enginnering."
4327,How I Learned Data Science,I want to enter in data science because I love calculus and stathistics.
4328,How I Learned Data Science,Which one do you prefer in case of self learning or learning from someone else?
4329,How I Learned Data Science,Can you please make a video or share little bit about how do you used the data science for your golf game?
4330,How I Learned Data Science,Yes this true path is different for everyone and in my case you are helping me to build my path very well....😀
4331,How I Learned Data Science,"Thank you for sharing all of this! We've had some pretty similar experiences up to about the consulting part, which I started in this fall. Definitely going to check out more of your videos!!"
4332,How I Learned Data Science,8:08
4333,How I Learned Data Science,"Hey I'm interested in data analysis/science too. Could you recommend any good books about data analysis in sports? I watched a movie ""Moneyball"" and it would be good to find out whether doing analysis in sports is useful. I'm a  huge fan of basketball (NBA). So if you could give any suggestions, I would appreciate it a lot."
4334,How I Learned Data Science,"Heck yeah, this was awesome!  Thanks for sharing your journey, Ken!"
4335,How I Learned Data Science,"Hello sir, 
I am doing Master in Computational and Data Science. I am currently learning some subjects like scientific computing, parallel computing, algorithm engineering, mathematics models for optimization problems. I want to know how important are these subjects in Data Science and Machine Learning because i want to deep into DS and Ml."
4336,How I Learned Data Science,"I'm 27 with a bocherlo's degree in finance and 4 years of experience in the retail bank sector (corporate credit risk analyst to be more precise). I've always been very curious about programming and data science, I even learned some basic coding back in HS. What are the odds for me to switch career to data science/analysis if I complete a 10 month specialization?"
4337,How I Learned Data Science,Do you use your skills for the other side of sports analytics? On the bet side?
4338,How I Learned Data Science,Hi sir what can you recommend and prefer ? I'm planning on taking Masters in Information Technology with especialized in Data Analytics or should I go for Masters in Business Analytics.. I'm currently working as Software testing engineer both Manual and Automation. Thanks for your feedback.
4339,How I Learned Data Science,Hello Mr. Ken. Keep going brother. My well wished will always be with you. I hope one day I will be successful  just like you😀.

4342,How I Learned Data Science,Good initiative Ken. I can't wait to start
4343,How I Learned Data Science,"Thanks for your videos, they def help a lot of ppl including me"
4344,How I Learned Data Science,Do I need a degree to become a data analyst/ scientist?
4345,How I Learned Data Science,Hey Ken I just wanted to say thank you for creating this channel and the content on it...I always had an interest in Data Science but felt like it had such a high barrier to entry for me I never really thought much of doing it..After graduating with my Bachelors in CS last year however I'll be entering grad school in a week for Data Science specifically with an intended goal to get into Sports Analytics for Baseball...and having only discovered your channel a week ago I've been binging a lot of your videos on Data Science and Sports Analytics and am really thankful for all the great information you provide in all of the videos!...I've been following quite a few CS/Software YouTube channels the past few years but always wished i could find a Data Science/Sports Analytics channel so stumbling upon your channel was awesome to have happen!
4346,How I Learned Data Science,You guys i.e data science youtubers are severly underrated.
4347,How I Learned Data Science,"Hi Ken Jee, thank you so much for sharing your experience on data science. I'm a statistics student and I am interested in data science. I learned some R and C++ programming language in my uni but I'm not that good in programming. Upon graduating, I hesitate on whether to start working or further study in master program. If further study in master program, what course do you suggest? Data science, computer science or any other relevant course? 
Looking forward to get your valued opinions. Thank you. ^^"
4348,How I Learned Data Science,"Awesome video Ken, really enjoyed learning from your experiences. I'm an engineering student looking into using consulting as a stepping stone into data science, but your video is giving me some second thoughts about the consulting piece. Are there some red flags about this plan that I'm not seeing? I've reached out on LinkedIn if you'd rather respond over PM. Thanks man!"
4349,How I Learned Data Science,"Hi Ken.. I just found your channel as I have been searching abt Data Science a lot. I am currently working as a Corporate Banker in the field of Digital Banking, Fintechs. I have a Tech Bachelor degree and a MBA in Finance. I want to learn DS, AI and want to switch to such career.. How do I take it ahead.. Pls guide me"
4350,How I Learned Data Science,Im now a junior majoring in finance. Can I still become a data scientist if I get a masters in business analytics or data science?
4351,How I Learned Data Science,"Hello Ken, How should I'm into digital marketing and interested in web analytics. Can you suggest what will be the best path for me? I have recently completed a one data science with python project."
4352,How I Learned Data Science,"You are too slow 😂 and good thing is you share quality content but sometimes i feel sleepy.
Please make changes in your story telling. May be this is the reason why you are not famous in ds but you deserve."
4353,How I Learned Data Science,"Man, all these just remind me myself, I tackled bunch of majors even filmmaking, then end up doing Economics. Now in my 25, I became data science freak. It's sad how those years were unproductive but I think everybody has a unique career and that brings us unique opportunities."
4354,How I Learned Data Science,Interesting story!
4355,How I Learned Data Science,"Hi Ken Jee, thanks for the great content!  I decided around March that I wanted to make a career change into data science and quickly realized it was going to take a lot longer than I originally thought.   Although I have a degree in aerospace engineering I have been working in sales for the past 8 years so my technical skills weren't where they needed to be.  Anyways,  after doing some research I came to the conclusion that starting out in a data analyst role might be a more attainable path for me because of my lack of experience and that form there I could transition into data science once I have real world experience.  
My question for you is, do you believe entering the industry as a data analyst is a good way to do it?  Also, do you have any tips for writing a good resume when you don't have experience?   
I have been taking online courses in SQL and Python and feel pretty proficient in SQL but not so much in Python, still need to work more on that.  
Thanks again for the great content, I appreciate the hard work you've put into sharing your knowledge."

4394,How I Learned Data Science,"hey Ken Dodji here. Thanks for your approach of teaching DS. Do you think you can spend some time on how to manage files with github and the flow of working between git hub, shell commands, and the jupyter notebooks. Your series on working on data science projects from scratch is the best by the way. Thank you."
4395,How I Learned Data Science,Yes. Story telling is under appreciated. It's not even really taught...
4396,How I Learned Data Science,"Hey Ken, great video. 
Went through your linkedin profile and found that you've done your masters from Depaul University.
I have been working as a Data Analyst for the past two years and was thinking of pursuing a graduate degree in the same university. Some questions.. 
1. How do you rate the Ms in CS with Machine learning electives as compared to the Ms in Data Science program at Depaul university?
2. And what course do you suggest if I plan on being a data scientist 3 years down the line?"
4397,How I Learned Data Science,"So I’ve been binge watching many of your videos, there’s not a lot of DS resources to begin with so first I wanna say thank u for putting stuff out there to help me. It’s like you’re my mentor. 

I have questions: Should I get a MS before getting a job or while I’m working? I’m a recent math major graduate, was planning to go to med school but then I wanted to do something in my field (math) and I learned about data science and I instantly knew, I’m doing DataQuest data science path, Do i even need a MS? Can you do a review of DataQuest? 

How much should I study a day? I’ve been studying 6-8 hours a day, after I finish my full time dead end job, just so I can get into a company I want and start being a data scientist. Rn I’m a beginner, just started in Feb, learned python, OOP, NumPy and Pandas and now I’m doing data aggregation and cleaning. Anyways, where can I practice? I feel like Kaggle is advanced for me and I feel like cheating if I don’t know how to do something and I look it up."
4398,How I Learned Data Science,"Damn, I switched majors a bunch of times too and decided to go wth economics because I felt like it was challenging enough to keep me focused. NOW I’m in my last semester and about to apply to a graduate program for data science to become a data scientist that will hopefully work in sports."
4399,How I Learned Data Science,"Hi Ken, great video. I recently finished my Master’s in Applied Analytics, but the Data Science learning journey is never over. I really appreciate your insight and perspective on the field of Data Science and Sports Analytics. Keep up the great work!"
4400,How I Learned Data Science,"Dude, You're amazing. Whenever I sidetrack myself from learning Data Science. Your videos really help me there in keeping me interested and intact to proceed to learn more about it. 
Love your content."
4401,How I Learned Data Science,Thank you so much for mapping out your path. I am curious to know what your thoughts are regarding health informatics and how feasible it would be for an informatics specialist to transition into data science?
4402,How I Learned Data Science,Why you r not popular? Underrated
4403,How I Learned Data Science,hello Ken
4404,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,Sir I'm from Bangladesh. I am doing bachelor in math. Can I go for data science?
4405,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,This is much needed video. As in most of the cases beginner spend alot of time learning math rather than doing data science. This video can clarify one confusion they data science is not a math field but just need some knowledge of mathematics.
4406,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,That is an excellent overview much needed topic that too in less than 5 minutes.
4407,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"As someone who found data analytics after statistics (and not the other way around), I don't feel intimidated by ""maths"" in data science, so, sorry, can't relate xD"
4408,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,Good thing I have a bachelors degree in mathematics! But I forgot all this stuff lol. Gotta relearn it all; definitely starting with statistics. I am currently a business analyst with 7 years experience and I really want to be a data scientist.
4409,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,Thank you very much.
4410,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,I remember starting with linear algebra for ML....it was a great experience
4411,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Hi Ken, 
Intermediate at Python now, I’m reading Practical Stats for DS by Peter Bruce.

I’m struggling to understand some basic concepts in stats even though I go through the resources at the end of each topic and Google. Some explanations vary greatly from one source to another. 
Do you recommend I complete the book and practice with projects ASAP, or invest more time in stats 101 etc?"
4412,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"So what would you recommend for calculus in a degree program? Calculus 1,2, and 3?"
4413,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"I'm very afraid of math. I spent 13 Years in digital marketing for e-commerce and IT Companies, I dealt with conversion rate optimization and i know basics of SQL, i wrote some web crawlers in Python and I can build interactive dashboards in PowerBI and Google Data Studio but i'm afraid of doing this full time because of math."
4414,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,I wish i knew what you are talking about xD I am not a native english speaker and i have never learned these things in english. 🤦‍♂️😅 So what i love in math is counting percentage and graphs and stuff like that. 🥴 What i don't love is doing these long {√π=÷×\}÷(π=[√] -----------) things. 😂 Told you i don't know how it's in english but you might get my point. 🥴
4415,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Thanks for the vid Ken, it was very informative"
4416,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Bad news I hated Math in my school days,  Good news I am liking it now because now I am actually implementing it."
4417,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,Great. See you in 5 years.
4418,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"#52: The medium link resource is really interesting, thank you for sharing it!
In Math, I have found super helpful the StatQuest YouTube channel, all concepts are digestible and easy to understand!
You both are a good combination of DS knowledge :)

4423,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,It seems so complicated. https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer explain the math so good.
4424,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,The resources provided in Tirthajyoti Sarkar's article are really helpful.... Thanks to him for article and thanks ken for your research...
4425,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,Is it advisable to do masters on mathematics in data science or data engineering and analytics.Which is the best?
4426,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"That's so informational, thank you Ken! 
I have a BS in Mathematics. What do you think is better to break in the data science field: a MS in Applied Science or a MS in Data Science?"
4427,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,Am joining uni next year here in morocco and i aim for applied mathematics major ..  u made me really intrested in data science
4428,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,is it good option to learn statistics  theory before python or both can go hand in hand ???
4429,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,Can you recommend any good course for calculus? something that starts from the basics?
4430,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Great stuff! Just one thing I'd like to start here: As a post graduate in Maths, I'd like to point out that Stats is a separate degree and we math majors don't really study stats and vice versa ( a lot of industry misconception around this). Although stats is basically Mathematics, it's a separate degree. Hopefully this clears doubts, I know a lot of you watching this video would be confused as to pursuing CS or  Math for your MS. Keep this comment in mind, hopefully this finds you."
4431,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,I’m have a math degree so I should be ok
4432,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"When you say probability theory, what level are we talking about? Like the ""probability theory"" class at my school is calculus based and requires us to have taken Multivariable calculus beforehand. Meanwhile I know a lot of concepts in probability theory can be taught to some extent without difficult calculus problems. For example, I just recently ordered a textbook: Probability for the enthusiastic beginner by David J. Morin. It doesn't assume any prior experience with calculus. It covers Combinatorics, Probability, Expectation Values, Distributions, Gaussian Approximations, Correlation, and Regression. Does this sound sufficient?"
4433,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Do I actually need to be able to solve integrals? I definitely get the calculus concepts in this video, but I just can't reliably solve anything more difficult than the integrals you do in the first 1-2 weeks of Calc 2."
4434,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Hey Ken, great vid! I'm planning to specialise in Data Science as a graduate, is learning Python a good place to start? I'm relying on my college to teach me math, but I've got a lot of free time on my hands, so I'm delving into Python. Terrified and excited at the same time :)"
4435,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,What I do is do a project..Use a library for doing what you want..and then go back To see how the library works whats the maths and the research behind it.. Because of this you always Have a example to relate to..
4436,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Hey Ken
Is the theory behind ML and DL concepts essential? For example there is a playlist for confusion matrix.So according to you knowing basic concepts is enough or all the theory behind the concepts is also important for a data scientist role?"
4437,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Hello, I have been following you for a long time and thank you for all the quality content you promote here! I want to develop my mathematical foundations for data science, here's how I thought: I start with the basics of algebra and geometry, then linear algebra, calculus, discrete math, operational research and statistics. What do you think about this planning?"
4438,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"At some point you may come across the Earth mover's distance and other metrics between distribution functions, the Bellman equation (in reinforced learning), wavelets (in data compression and filtering), bootstrap and simulation, Gaussian processes,... fortunately, for the most part, elementary functions will do"
4439,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"hey Ken, did you have to take additional math courses to get into your CS program? if someone works a normal 9-5 job and their CC has affordable online math courses, would you recommend they take stats, discrete, linear, and multivariable calc versus try to learn this stuff on their own?"
4440,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,I'm nearly 33 and have just recently decided to become a data scientist. Is there any hope for someone that was never good (abysmal) at mathematics to get into this field?
4441,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,Any recommended text books?
4442,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"I really appreciate you doing this. I am a Physician, but data is the future. Thank. 🙏🏾"
4443,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,Could you recommend some book/s that cover the probablity and statistics needed for data science? Thanks!
4444,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,Thank you.
4445,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Can I, a person with no maths background or base even think of getting into Data Science?"
4446,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Hey Ken! Amazing video first of all
So I'm a business undergrad student and I've been really interested in analytics for sometime now. I do not have a background in computer science but I'm familiar w a few statistics concepts. I've also started learning python side by side to eventually use it properly.
Do u think I should get these math concepts down before learning more python? Also I know I'm already v late (21) but I just find it fascinating and imo just makes me more employable at the end"
4447,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"tl;dr of the video-

4449,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,Hypothesis testing is basically all of inferential statistics. Which specific tests are most often used by practicing data scientists?
4450,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,What sarkar pls come again????
4451,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"This may seem like a silly question, but how much should I expect to retain in my calculus and statistics knowledge gained from math classes once I am actually working in the field? Should it be expected that I could whip open any calculus textbook and solve a any math problem without having to look at notes? I only ask this because when looking at advanced calculus videos on YouTube, it makes me wonder how I will ever be able to retain all what I've learned, especially when I begin learning differential equations, exterior derivatives, pull-backs, and other advanced topics which as of now seem like a foreign language to me."

4483,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"I thought you said ""I got a B in calculus"", then relistened and heard you said ""D"" :D I was already judging you ;'P"
4484,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,what maths are needed for sports analytics & moneyball?
4485,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Im really at the beginning, just started at the Open University, and it was a good overview what to expect."
4486,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Thankyou, sir.."
4487,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Really enjoying your vids, Ken. You could easily just make a bunch of those flashy ""salary of a data scientist"" or ""day in the life of a data scientist"" videos that have been beaten into the ground by every other youtuber, but instead you're sharing much more relevant and actionable info. Keep it up!"
4488,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"I am tossing between Statistics or Applied and  Computational Mathematics as my major but I can't seem to figure out which one I should do. I like data analysis and using R but I also like mathematical modelling with differential equations and such. Most of the uncertainty for me comes from not knowing the type of work I would be doing in the real world. Do you have any advice?

PS. Very informative video, first time watching."
4489,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Hi Ken , your videos are very informative and keep me motivated on my data science journey. If you can please make more videos on the fundamentals of data science , it would be very helpful. Thank you"
4490,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,thank you sir
4491,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,100% agreed.
4492,Math Needed for Mastering Data Science,"Hi ken Im pursuing a masters in applied statistics and data analytics with an emphasis in biostatistics i find that it might be overkill for doing data science. My original goal was to apply learned knowledge as a biostatisician  but throughout this entire year I've just been more drawn to data science and its business applications and am now leaning towards the business analytics concentration. Nonetheless, super stoked for the future and truly enjoy watching your channel. Only a matter of time until you explode!


p.s. also calculus was the first class I was not able to pass and also recovering from it lol"

4605,How to Make A Data Science Portfolio Website with Github Pages,Thank you so much
4606,How to Make A Data Science Portfolio Website with Github Pages,"Hey Ken! I have question regarding a portfolio website. Is it bad if ""stole"" my portfolio website github page from someone else. I found this https://orysyastus.github.io/ github pages website and I really like the way this person has everything laid out and I was just gonna fork it and put my own information and my own projects on it. 

But does that look bad to a future employer? Like I was too lazy to create my own portfolio from scratch? And the other thing I worry about it is what if like 5,000 other people all had the same idea as me and then my portfolio page looks identical to other people that all forked from this same github page lol. Curious to hear your insight on these concerns/thoughts I've had when it comes to making a portfolio website"
4607,How to Make A Data Science Portfolio Website with Github Pages,"Hey, Ken! Would it be alright if I just put links to my Kaggle notebooks in my GitHub portfolio or are there some important benefits from basically copying into GitHub repos?"

The great thing is that you can also just buy a cheap domain and let it redirect to your Github-Page,
so you do not even need to buy a certificate to enable HTTPS.
It really is just the flatout easiest way to build a good looking personal portfolio!"

1.is ms in data science really worth it from current and future of industry persepectie, like I am seeing that some people prefer 2 years of industrial experience over 2 years of masters but I really like ml and want to publish papers in this domain. 
2.Now i have read couple of books on ml and DL but now i am confused whether (a) . to start learning practical application of ML(like I have build a model but what next..... To make my model more interactive and useful, like I don't want to show companies my (.py file), so to solve that problem maybe I should go for MLops(devops + ml) or
(2) .read more research papers, learn new and advance algo and techniques which no books or course teaches u, start doing competition and maybe go for writing a research paper which would be very helpful for my  ms admission in good college.
Can u help, like any advice would help a lot on what should my direction of working after gaining so much knowledge but have very little practical knowledge of impelnting.

4672,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Hey Ken Jee, thanks so much for your videos, I have a confusion which I can't find a valid solution else where. It is regarding outliers.  In real data, outliers can exist in more than half of the features and make analysis challenging. 

Should I remove all outliers? When is the best time (or stage) to remove them?  During data cleaning or after building the very first model for inference?

Thanks!"

4681,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"In case you are confused with multiplying the hourly rate by 2, here what it happens under the hood: 2000 = 8hrs/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks.  The year has 52 weeks but 2 of those weeks are assigned to holidays and vacation time."
4682,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),you are the best brother <3
4683,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"hey Ken, I am doing my version of this project in R,
I have a question, when I find that Age is not normally distributed and that most of the data set are not old companies
what should I do then regarding analyzing the age? can I still depend on Age and see how Salary changes as a company gets older ?
or this means that there is under representation of the old companies in the data set and I can't draw any conclusions from the Age variable w.r.t the no. of job postings and Salary?"
4684,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Have you ever did EDA on your own linkdin profile ...I came across this in Linkdin feed where they do eda and make dashboard on your own linkdin  data

4686,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"while scraping the glassdoor website it is redirecting to an Indian website is there any way I can stop it.

can anyone just guide me on how can I rectify it it will be really grateful

I stopped manually but the scrapping results are not convincing, like sometimes I am able to scrap the salary properly sometimes not."
4687,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Is there any reason you didn’t Start out with Pandas Profiling just to take a quick scan of the data?
4688,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"The best thing about this video was watching Ken getting stuck, trying hard to figure out how to resolve the errors and googling the seaborn code. Just made me feel that it is totally okay to not know everything. Thank you Ken :)"
4689,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"thanks for sharing the whole process, including all 'surprises' along the way with error and google searches. Most people this that only geniuses can make it. This helps to ""humanize"" the data science process haha"
4690,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Ken, I understand the value of understanding the data you are working with, but could you explicitly tell us what are the outputs you expect from an EDA and how it impacts the outcome of the model and of the project in general?"
4691,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"hey every1 if yall faced an issue with the nltk downloading (namely wordcloud error)  if u dont have the package use this

import nltk

nltk.download()"
4692,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Hey Ken, I really appreciate this series but I worry about the dependant variable being the 'Glassdoor Estimate' It seems overly possible that any trends that you find in this EDA are properties of the Glassdoor Salary Estimate algo. Anyhow, this is great as a proof of concept. I would love for you to make a 'Data Science from Scratch 2.0' where you tackle a problem in the sports domain, where you are an expert and there is a wealth of real-world data to choose from!"
4693,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"hey ken  , while i am performing my wordcloud code part , i am getting this error ""The _imagingft C module is not installed"" , what should i do?"

4697,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Greate series!
4698,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Complete data noob here. My work uses Excel for data analysis and reporting, etc. Sounds like switching to Python (I'm a CS student so I love it) and Jupyter could be a good move. Is there a lot that can be done with these methods that Excel can't? Assuming the data is already cleaned and ready to analyze"
4699,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),U r the best...simply awesome videos

4702,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),When do we remove the NaN or null values and outliers in the dataset?
4703,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),This was such a fascinating video to watch. I think this is my favorite in the series so far and one that i'll be definitely coming back to and making some detailed notes on. Thanks for sharing the wealth of your knowledge :)
4704,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"As a python developer, I can safely say that to be able to do data science, one doesnt really have to have that deep an understanding of python. Its more about learning the concepts that you are laying out in these videos. The learning of python should be your own separate thing. 

Really enjoy the content BTW. Nice one @Ken Jee"
4705,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"What are some benefits to using spyder as opposed to jupyter notebook for your other steps?  or is this just preference?  GREAT videos man, really enjoy all your content."

4708,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Hi Ken, thanks for this awesome series. I'm literally stuck at the end of this tutorial, it looks like stopwords variable isn't really pointing at the Corpusreader object in nltk. I'm getting the error code TypeError: 'WordListCorpusReader' object is not iterable. Any tips?"
4709,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Hi Ken, just an idea to better extract seniority information, if we could take how many years experience required from the job description, that would be a good indicator. For now a lot of jobs `seniority` is `na`. Just my 2 cents opinion.

Also, do you still accept resume revision request? I've watched your serious of videos on resume and modified mine accordingly, it'd be great if you can take a quick look at it and provide any feedback, thank you so much!"
4710,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Hi, Ken, what's the practical way to prevent multicollinearity. hv we done anything to prevent it in this project? Because I didn't see  any prevention after you creating the corr heatmap. :)"

4721,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Hey, for those who get stuck with multiple off 'Location' (i got multiple 'Location being like ""los angeles"" for Ken Jee).
It's not an optimal code but it does the job :
#Making every names a state abreviation
def state_simplifier(state):
    if  'utah' in state.lower():
        return 'UT'
    elif 'new jersey' in state.lower():
        return 'NJ'
    elif 'greenwood village' in state.lower():

        return 'US'
    else :
        return state
df['job_state'] = df.job_state.apply(state_simplifier)
And to get rid of all the space after that i simply used a lambda -> replace : 
#getting rid of the spaces
df['job_state'] = df.job_state.apply(lambda x: x.replace(' ',''))
Hope it can help someone ! Have fun codding !"
4722,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"people, when to pass axis parameter, in DataFrame.apply() function ?

I am currently learning Python, R and statistics to do it more professionally, and in the future I would like to be able to do predictions/ML to bring even more value to the business. I fear that strict data roles may get me too far from the business routine, what could be a problem as I do enjoy living in the supply chain area. I am not sure if being a Data Scientist is my ultimate goal, but I also don't know which roles would be more aligned to my objectives. How do you think Data Analyst/Data Science roles would blend with more business roles?"

Just a small question, im currently an industrial engineering student (so i have a good background in statistics) and have enrolled in the EDX IBM data science certificate program. I have finished all the courses (excpet for the SQL one which i will start soon) and feel like im fine with the coding and concepts (regressions, clustering, classification, etc. ) but do not know where to go from here since i have only worked on 1 project (the capstone from the course). As a next step i am thinking of learning tableau (for data visualization) and SQL, but apart from that what do you suggest i do ?
Thanks"

The nice graphics were a great addition to your video, especially since they really fit well with a topic like this one - showing what role is located where in the project lifecycle. I'm excited to se what you come up with next! :D"
4798,Different Data Science Roles Explained (by a Data Scientist),"Hi Ken thanks for making this video. I found this very helpful. 
I have a question. As I am in my senior year of computer science student, I am not sure whether I should go further into master. Especially, when I look up the job openings, all data scientists are usually required to hold at least a master degree. Is it necessary for a data scientist or relatable positions as you mentioned in this video to have a master or even Ph.D in Data Science field? 
Thanks and please keep continuing to make this kind of video!"

4806,Different Data Science Roles Explained (by a Data Scientist),"Between EDA and  “model building”, where would you include feature engineering, feature selection , model validation? I ask because I have sadly seen MLE job postings where there is zero “modeling” work. I often find myself in this very situation at my current job where I merely productionize models created by more senior data scientists. So yea I wonder how you think about the different interpretations of these roles in the industry =) ."
4807,Different Data Science Roles Explained (by a Data Scientist),Awesome break down. I noticed that a majority of my time I spend on projects or learning is just cleaning data and exploratory analysis.

4896,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Insightful. Thank you very much!
4897,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Hi Ken, It took me 1 year to learn to fully solve a rubix cube. For whole one year I was able to solve the 2 layers only, Finally I decided that I need to finish the cube and learn 3rd layer as well. Within a week I learned to whole cube. My personal best is 2 minutes 34 seconds now. But thats not the point. Point is now I am a hotel management student, with MBA in finance from Third tier institute, It is great deal in learning programming and stats , but that cube give me strength that I can. Sooner or later I will figure out everything and become expert. Thanks Ken Jee for inventing #66daysofdata to keep ourselves stick to the plan and get going."
4898,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,The struggle is REAL
4899,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Awesome... Simple very effective metaphor
Thanks a lot"
4900,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"couldn't agree anymore :)

I think that kind of mindset must be had for all kind of goals that we want to achieve, because some people usually blame the abstract way instead of choosing one and develop little by little"
4901,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,I hope your Rubik's analogy isn't *too* accurate. I never solved more than one side of that damn thing in the 80s and gave up. I hope that doesn't mean I'm lacking the perseverance/chops for data science 😬
4902,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Hey K, You are correct sir.  My saying for the vast majority of 'life on earth' is ""Small Victories"". For instance, one rarely has *massive battles*, *huge upsets* and *gigantic victories*, instead we have many *Small Victories* that build to winning the battle."
4903,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Thank you.

Since learning that this field exists 6 months ago it's all I think about, and all I want to do. That being said, I have 0 technical background and am starting this journey at 40. Much harder for me to learn and retain at 40 than it was at 20. 

As much as I beat myself up for not getting it fast enough, I also try to celebrate the small wins too.

Stumbled onto your channel a few days ago and can't get enough. Thank you for this, and all the other videos. They really help."
4904,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Hi Ken! Does learning Computational Geometry help you in the field of Data Science?
4905,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Hey Ken jee, I hope you'll be able to help me with my thought: does venturing into data science naturally means degrading your eyesight since you'll be staring at the screen? What can be done about it? And especially of the programming and casual gaming aspect, because 
1) I hardly come across topics about eyesight when it comes to these 
2) Asian parents equate computer screen = bad XD
Thanks for taking time off in advance!"

4907,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"I see you too have Homo Deus there, another reason why I'm learning Data Science or technology in general hehe.."
4908,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Thanks for this video 👍🏻😃
4909,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Little steps are key!  One thing that I’ve found to be super helpful in learning data science concepts is to read 3 google scholar articles on the topic at hand.  I did this for the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm and I was surprised how I could start to understand the math after continued exposure. I still don’t have neural networks or naive Bayes methods down, but I hope I can do the same there."
4910,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Hey Ken, I recently graduated from university with a major in psychology and a double minor in computer science and mathematics. I struggled a lot with the learning environment of university, and unfortunately wasn't able to pursue a masters degree. Instead, I've taken a real interest in data science, more specifically machine learning, and have starting taking some courses online! I plan on doing a data science bootcamp later, which looks promising from the research I've done. My plan is extremely raw, but I hope to combine machine learning and psychology for the benefit of therapy and other aspects of the human mind! I just wanted your advice and general thoughts on my situation. Thanks so much! Love the channel by the way, so happy I found you."

4914,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Ken Jee sir i am excited for your Q&A .What about coming live for it on YouTube
4915,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Ken Jee Sir , Your video is really useful. I know the concept of data science but don't know how to practice programming.please suggest something to how should I practice the python to get better in programming use it for DS and ML ."
4916,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Awesome video! Which resources did you use for the maths ? :)
4917,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,A great instructor who is putting out sincere content!
4918,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Ken sir you're absolutely correct.But remember when you got out of this hurdle and pass rubix or complete learning data science or anything you will get a great reward for it
4919,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Your are seriously underrated
4920,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Hey Ken, I had just finish all the modules in 365 data science except for the new BA module. I am revisiting ML and DL(Tensorflow2) as i guess these are the basics which i have to be solid in to progress. The risk credit is the most difficult and i had yet to fully understand it.  Time series and customer analytics are much easier to understand. The final five modules are basically implementation and are mainly ML. How should i advance? like learning more advanced ML and DL? Should i just go kaggle instead? or borrow books to enhance my skills? as i do not know how vast the world of ML and DL is. LOL. Thanks"
4921,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Thanks Ken, I have already started to break bigger problem to smaller manageable ones. I hope will learn the skills soon"
4922,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,such an honest answer
4923,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"@ken good lesson.  It's easy to get overwhelmed with the choices we have and stall your progress as a result.  One tutorial, one project at a time.  Keep up the good work!"
4924,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"this video is a good guide for a beginner like me! ""start somewhere and usually doesn't matter where"" sounds like gradient descending my ML knowledge loss😂😂"
4925,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,hopefully I can also persevere. I have been taking the Kaggle micro courses but recently I’m thinking about quitting because the machine learning part is getting frustratingly hard. I have so many questions because the reading doesn’t explain every line of code thoroughly. Mindlessly copypasting code from tutorial to exercise problems really makes me question the rationale of learning data science. I have no one to ask for help so I think it’s extra hard because I have to google everything which is super time consuming and I don’t often find the answers I need.
4926,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"great vid man, i also come from business background , and now struggling to learn DS and ML especially the math part. keep up the good job"
4927,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,I liked what you said about focusing on the individual steps without looking up too often - I look up to check my progress too frequently and end up feeling overwhelmed about how much is still left to learn. Thanks Ken!
4928,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"hey ken jee, when are algorithms and data structures required in data science life cycle and when should you learn it when starting your learning process"
4929,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Ken thank you so much for this video. All of the advice given are so valuable and I really needed to hear them. Thank you for all your amazing content.
4930,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"This was a really great analogy towards the process of learning data science. This reminds me of my data structures class from freshman year where my professor said that even though that most people will have the same type of code to solve a problem, there are many different ways to approach it. Pretty much just like how there are many different ways to learn something. I'm still on this journey as well and just like the advice given here, I use resources that make the most sense to me when I'm developing projects. I relate to the small wins thing as well whether it would be making tutorials for Data Science concepts for the organization that I'm a part of, the Bit Project, or making projects through the knowledge that I have gained through tutorials. Of course my code wouldn't be as complex as someone else's work, the important thing is that I made something that I'm proud of and that the ability to continuously learn will get you far on this journey. Thank you for the wonderful content as always and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day 🙂"
4931,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Hola hola
4932,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Thank you so much for your content! I feel more confidence, drive, and motivation when I follow your advice."
4933,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,A video of yours (where you mentioned accountability) popped up in my YouTube feed after I missed a week or 2 of online data science class 😂. This video gave me at least enough confidence to continue.Thanks alot (from the Philippines).
4934,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Hi. Thank you for this video. Myself I’m a undergrad majoring in  business information systems. I’ve been trying watching videos on data science and etc. I’m still trying to navigate what I want to do in the future with my major. Also I’ve been getting my certifications and areas in data science and cyber security too.
4935,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Amazing video...I also believe in divide and conquer approach...which always works
4936,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"I already had a solid Math background when I started learning DS - but my graduation was 25 years ago :) I also had a LOT of programming experience, but not in Python or R. And still, my greatest problem wasn't the Math or the Python, it was *lack of the systematic approach*.
When you go for one of the countless ""become a data scientist in 10 hours"" course, you don't really understand that material. The worst thing is you might THINK you understand it, but that's a false feeling. There is no way to understand it all in 10 hours, be prepared for a long journey or retreat. There are three books that I recommend to everyone:
1). Mathematics for Data Scientists (M.P.Deisenroth and others) - all math you will need in a convenient form.
2). Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analysis (Johh D. Kelleher and others) - everything about Machine Learning except for the neural networks.
3). Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron - a great book about Deep Learning (you may skip the other parts).

All three books have a lot of exercises, and you should do ALL of them. After that you will know enough to consider your knowledge solid. I've stopped on the exercises for the very first chapter for now, though I've read the books, of course :)"
4937,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Thanks a lot, Ken. Can you please suggest some books to read, for Data Science. Thanks"
4938,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Amazing as always, Ken! :)"
4939,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"you entered the field when data science was something only a handful of people could do. now, you need much greater expertise to enter the field, esp with the economy the way it is."
4940,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Wow Ken, it is amazing to see how much your channel has grown when you had a few hundred subscribers and now 50k! Keep up the good work!"
4941,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Hi Ken, as always it's a pleasure to watch your video that distinguishes you from the many yackers around talking about data science.

When i was listening to you, it came into my mind Tim Ferris and i thought about ""selection"", one of the key steps to learning.
In my idea, to learn data science the first step involves figuring out what are the most frequently used and important mathematical models and algorithms. 
Once we have this shortlist, we can select key programming languages - i personally opt for Python and R - and try to work out real-world problems with these 2 languages. 

How, do we do to know if we are gonna do well? One way is to pick algorithms as performed in any of the courses you proposed (or even in Kaggle, where i have been starting giving a look), implementing to the real-world problems as said above and double-checking the solution by implementing the same algorithms using secondary, high-level programming environments like Matlab or Mathematica. 
I know that mathematica has lot of functions that help you do what in python requires dozens of lines. 

Just sharing with you this crazy ideas ;-) Ciao!"
4942,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Thank You Ken. Your videos are really helping me to change my perception towards this new challenge. More power to you man!
4943,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Hello sir you're a sports analyst know i have one idea regarding duck worth Lewis method how i can contact you for sharing the idea plz reply sir
4944,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Hi Ken , this video appeared right exactly when I just gave up doing my Coursera course in math for data science, as I couldn't solve function approximation task . Seems like I am too dumb and don't have enough math background to be data scientist . Science I only can code, but when it comes to advanced math related problems, I feel depressed. Did you have the same feelings or it just me ? These advanced math related problems really scare me 😓 didn't expect to face such problems where I don't even understand the task itself 😓"
4945,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Hey been watch your channel for a while, great stuff...
Could we get an in-depth video on the differences between a Data Scientist and Data Engineer?
It would be really helpful."
4946,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Ken, I too was all over the place and felt like I wasn't going anywhere. So, a few months ago, I refocused and decided to learn SQL/NoSQL first. Just 2 weeks away from completing 8 certificates (just to give my learning journey some context), I estimate I'll be at an advanced intermediate level. My next ""puzzle"" will be math and statistics. Wish me luck going forward."
4947,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Another great video! <3
I think the advice you give is very useful, because I've been following the same methodology when learning Data Science for the past year. I'm try to understand and practice each individual part of the whole process of building a project first and then in the end everything manages to piece together perfectly after that. I've been solving Rubik's cubes as a hobby since 2009, so I think I'm pretty good at not giving up when something gets difficult. Just as you said, it takes a lot of time and patience, but with enough motivation and hard work, you eventually reach your goal. ^-^"
4948,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Here's my plan

I'm good with computers, Python is sorted
1. Applied Data Science with Python on Coursera (got for free using university email)
2. Think Stats 
3. Business Essentials on Coursera (again free)
4. Kaggle"

Can you make a video on the learning path for AI? 
I am a first year undergraduate in Computer Engineering and want to study AI, but I don't know the right sequence of approaching things. 
It would be very helpful of you if you could do it

Regards🙂"
4956,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"Hey man, knowing that it's not that uncommon to struggle in these topics is quite relieving, thanks for sharing!"
4957,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Thank you very much for making me realize I'm not the only one facing these hurdles.
4958,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,"This is a good analogy, Ken. Luckily I took relevant courses step by step over the years, so I only had to focus on certain things when learning DS. I can only imagine how daunting it would be to jump over a huge hurdle (or to climb up a huge mountain as you mentioned) in front of people who are just starting to learn.
I believe this video can guide people who are just about to learn data science in the right direction. 
It's important to take small steps at a time, instead of trying to do everything at once."
4959,Why You're Struggling to Learn Data Science,Hi Ken! Thank you for your video! To be honest I have literally watched almost all your videos and get excited when ever you post a video. Can you make another series on Data science projects like you did previously?  Thank you!

I face problem after building a model that is I am struggling to enhance my accuracy. My data overfits and my accuracy keeps on stuck there and then and there's no one to guide me. What to do?"
5007,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,"Thank you so much for making these very informational and insightful videos! I’m a rising college freshman, and I foresee myself watching all your videos as I begin self-learning data science this summer break!"
5008,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,"I love your videos and the channel, but get very distracted by your eyes flickering when you read the script. I don't know if it's just me, I think it would be a better experience to just have a VoiceOver or something, or maybe putting the script in notes format in front of you, occasionally looking down is okay. Thanks, and keep up! :)"

5023,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,Your videos really inspire me a lot <3
5024,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,Very well-structured advice. Subscribed and looking forward to more videos
5025,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,your videos are amazing
5026,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,Thanks a ton for this video Ken! I recently dropped out of my physics PhD after going through some hard times financially and after falling in love with data science. Your videos are absolutely invaluable to me and I'm very appreciative of the work you put into them!
5027,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,"I don't feel so bad now spending half the time I devote each day to acquiring data analyst/science skills in learning math: linear algebra, statistics and probability, and calculus. A live stream video reviewing resumes or projects would be highly valuable.  Now back to practicing multiplying matrices I go!"
5028,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,"I will do as you suggest and watch those videos before asking you :) if you downt have it already, maybe some playlist would be a good idea. “My recommended order of watching”, “See these before asking me questions”. I would at least like it. I plan on watching all of the videos, but with the corona situation, closed kindergartens and schools, I’m trying to learn statistical analysis while having 3 small kids home, so it may take some time. Anyway you have already given me the most clear information on what a data scientist actually do, and I only have a little more than a year left of my bachelor’s. So thank you 👍🏻"
5029,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,Awesome this is a very good concept to share  and you are right most people watching this  are self directed. Thanks for sharing .
5030,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,"@Ken Jee  hello ken, i am pursuing masters degree in data science and planned to graduate in August. I am now worried about job market due the present situation. How bad it would be impacted in terms of data science job market and economy?  Is there any crisis we are facing? Please make a video if possible!!"
5031,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,"Good book suggestion and the time to publicise its values. I finished Young's book at the end of last year, and it really helped me be a more attentive learner. I utilised a Trello board to track down the list of resources - following the meta-learning principle.
Fully agree with you on the other parts as well like directness and feedback. I found that to be the keystone habit for me in last few months, as I always regurgitate information to the point where I can explain concepts like JOINs/LEFT JOINs without having to refer repeatedly to other resources. 
Thanks Ken!"
5032,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,Nice man. I've been trying to get a copy of Ultralearning but Amazon's all backed up on shipping because of the situation 😅
5033,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,yes
5034,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,"Another quality video Ken! I love non fiction books, so this ""review a book and apply it to data science"" type of style is right up my alley. I think it brings in a lot more video ideas too!"
5035,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,I started my data science course work based on your suggestions thanks Ken😀
5036,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,Great video! I would love to see you do live streams and engage with your audience. Your channel is small enough to talk to your audience but should take advantage of that before it goes big ;)
5037,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,"Good job, thanks for the video."
5038,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,"If you would be interested in me doing a live stream where I review resumes or projects, please let me know in the comments below! Ultralearning Book: @t"
5039,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,Keep going pro
5040,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,"Thank you, Ken! 🤗 I’m taking up algorithms from scratch right now, just the basics, and you often mention, that data science is about using the best way to solve the task. This kinda scares me. Are there, in reality, effective and reliable ways to make sure, that the algorithm and solution for a task were chosen correctly. Should I be less scared by this? I’ve just started learning, and for me this seems, that experimenting can be endless. Would be cool, if you break or confirm this fear 🥴thank you again, I love your videos! 🥰"
5041,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,Videos where you review someone's projects and CV would definitely be valuable. Keep up the good work! :)
5042,How to ULTRALEARN Data Science,"Hey Ken, Great video! Right now I’m in the beginning phase. I am enrolled in Johns Hopkins course for data science due to employment benefits and it’s free. Since Hopkins is biostatistics and clinical research based, the course is taught in R. I am learning because I want a job in data science, but not exclusively in biostatistics. I also prefer Python over R. My question is: should I enroll in another course that is Python based and focus on that for a more generalized approach or should I just stick with the Hopkins course? Thank you!"
5043,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,I'm at DePaul doing the MS in Computer Science myself! I'm focusing on Software & Machine Learning with the goals of becoming a Machine Learning Engineer (or potentially going further in academia).
5044,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,"I think by cs master we would be better at coding rather than data science master
Is it true?"
5045,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,"Thanks for the video. I’m curious, do you see any benefit to getting an MBA and an MS in DS? I have a scholarship that will pay for most of both, but I’m also 35 and hesitant to go back to school for that long. If so, would you suggest one before the other? If not, could I still break in to some of the more technical roles with an MBA?"
5046,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,Do you have a video on how to prepare for a master in CS? My background is in chemistry so I’ve never taken any CS classes.
5047,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,Great insights shifu Ken jee 😁
5048,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,"When I was starting my Ph.D. in Computational Biology, I discovered Data Science. Now I'm slowly changing my focus to it.
CompBio uses many disciplines and concepts in common with DS, which was a very satisfying discovery when I started to read about DS.
I think it's very nice to be called Master, but man, Doctor Weiss sounds *SO evil scientist* that I couldn't help myself when choosing my path.
It's just what I wanted since I was 4 LOL
But seriously, although I'm just migrating but not there yet, it seems to me that many (or most) areas that include programming and statistics will have a good match in DS."
5049,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,"Hi there. I have bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and master's degree in Mechatronics. Currently, I am in UK and looking for an opportunity in Data Science. I am getting an offer to do MSc in Computer Science from Swansea University. With my interest in Data Science and educational background, is it worth doing MSc in Computer Science?"
5050,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,"Hi Ken, What do you think of DePaul's current MSc DS program?

It seems more like its predecessor Predictive Analysis. I just saw that you teach there so I am like 100% more motivated to apply. :) :) 


Also what are the best US schools for MSc in DS for towards a path to PhD? 
Thank you chief."
5051,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,"Why didn't you choose a master's in Applied Statistics?

I just put in an application for a grad certificate in Applied Stats yesterday. The choice of school was made for me by these factors;
1. No GRE required
2. No recs required
3. Three intakes a year so no waiting till next year
4. Non-exirbitant tuition (under $1,000 per credit)
5. On-line program"
5052,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,"So, your choice of discipline, or school didn't determine the outcome?  Spoiler alert: it was you.  I know multiple guys who (not a joke) went to Harvard, MIT, Stanford and/or Berkeley and didn't do half as well as some people that went to the school I went to.  Sadly, that wasn't me: but I can't complain."

5054,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,Thank you for the information Ken... It will help me to take the decision in the future...
5055,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,"Hello Ken! Thanks for the content!

I recently moved from Brazil to Saint Charles (about 1h from Chicago) so as to stay with my wife and thought that pursuing a masters, instead of only self learning, could give me an edge when looking for a job here. I graduated in Industrial Engineering and am pursuing a masters in data science, preferably in the Chicago area.

Is pursuing a masters a good idea given that I do not currently have a diploma that local employers would recognize?
How much does the prestige of the university matter for professional outcome?
What is, in your opinion, best for professional outcome? An online but more prestigious degree or an on site but less prestigious degree? In Brazil there is prejudice against online learning.
What are your thoughts on University of Illinois at Chicago and Illinois Institute of Technology in general, but also regarding their Business Analytics and Data Science masters ?
Given that I have what I believe could be considered a ""technical background"" what do you believe would be important in a masters in data science? Hard or soft skills?
How was your experience at DePaul? Quality of classes and professional outcome wise.

Sorry for this avalanche of questions. Hope you can answer them as I believe it would be of great help. Thank you!"
5056,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,Side comment you made that I find really interesting. That the education was similar everywhere you went but the students were all different. Part of the reason I want to go to a master's program or top company is to surround myself with different people than my upper middle tier college (Seton Hall). Would love to see a video talking about that it even interview you on the topic.

5132,Discouraged with Data Science? - Watch THIS video.,"hello, I would really appreciate an advice on choosing between data science and software engineering.
I studied Economics ad University, but it has never been my passion.

After years of academic studies in the field of Economics I started coding for the first time, in Python.
Since then I developed a true passion for programming.

I currently know Python very well as well as Django to a basic level. I have done several projects with these.
During this path I also had the opportunity to learn Data Science/ML basics.

I am really undecided on which career to pursue.

These are the things I like mostly:
- programming, a lot (this would make me think I more suitable for software engineering)
- using Git and Github
- discovering insights, extracting meanings (this sounds more like data science)
- creativity. I feel I am very creative, and not really a math person.
- languages, both computer and human: I love english (I am not english mother tongue)

I find Data Science fascinating and being a data scientist would surely ""make more sense"" given my background compared to being a software engineering. Also, it requires some skills such as clear communication and presentation skills that I feel I have. However, I fear that data science would not value what I think are (or might become) my strongest skills, creativity and programming, and instead would require me to work more on math on a daily basis. I do not think I would enjoy working with math every day.

5134,Discouraged with Data Science? - Watch THIS video.,"The “Impostor Syndrome” usually refers to the nagging fear of being labeled a fraud for having a job we don’t feel we’re qualified for or receiving an award or recognition that we don’t feel we actually deserve.
A variation should be called the “Average Person Syndrome” for the frustrating feeling of not being “enough”. News and social media frequently show us things like grade school students developing apps or web sites to address some issue of the Covid pandemic, or podcasters, YouTubers and Twitter tech influencers with thousands of followers. This can leave “average” people second guessing their ideas and projects as not being significant “enough” when compared to others on display."
5135,Discouraged with Data Science? - Watch THIS video.,"Heavily relate to feeling overwhelmed at times!

I've always felt overwhelmed when I think about how vast the field of data science is and all that there is to learn and keep up with.

What helped me was understanding that I will not 100% know and understand everything and that is okay, nobody does:)

Taking small baby steps and learning through 1 project as a time has been a huge success for me & for those trying to learn, I highly recommend the ""Data Science Project By Scratch"" series on Ken's channel!"

If you choose Data Science and if you manage to get a job you will be paid half the amount of a SWE as a fresher. 
It leads to doubt... Am I doing the right thing?"
5166,Discouraged with Data Science? - Watch THIS video.,"Great content as always. I have a question, maybe it will help others too. 

I'm starting fresh in the DS journey. There's one thing that got me a bit discouraged, and I felt you targeted this issue in one of your videos too:
One of the big reasons I decided to switch to DS is being an International career; I saw myself joining a firm, and later switching jobs, industries, even countries very easily (just like Software Engineers ^^).

However, I sensed that it's not the case with DS? I sensed like if I joined a certain industry as Data Scientist, my skills won't be easily transferable to other industries. For example, you joined the DS world in the sport industry, right? Do you feel your experience is easily transferred to other industries (like automotive, social media, music, retail, etc...). Landing a job in a different company/industry is easy?

Your opinion is much appreciated!"
5167,Discouraged with Data Science? - Watch THIS video.,"Hey, Ken. I have small request for you.

Can you also pass my prize to the next winner. You already have given me many resources through this competition and those are really useful for me.

I'm really grateful🤗 to you for your support and efforts for the community."
5168,Discouraged with Data Science? - Watch THIS video.,"Great video, Ken. What I realized overtime is that you’ll never be free of worry, anxiety or feelings of inadequacy. But what I’ve learned to accept is that these feelings are your body and mind’s way of self-regulating to push you past your comfort zone. 

Life is a struggle, learning new fields of study is a struggle, but as long as you learn to accept the struggle and push forward regardless, when you zoom out you should get a better picture in how much you’ve accomplished over a course of time. And you should be very proud about that."

In the end, we made it. We have to love the struggle, we don´t get paid well because it´s easy, but because it´s hard. 
Splitting it up really helps, taking a break helps. Good advice in the video :-). Pro tip: To make it really stick, teach a colleague about it or make a youtube video about it. Kinda selfish reasons for a YT channel, but in the end it´s win-win ;-)"

5197,Data Science Advice for College Students,"Thanks for your video, sir! I'm now a freshman at university, when it's time to choose major. Do you recommend me to choose pure computer science or data science. I am confused because the major of data science is set in the school of bussiness at my university. There are many bussiness course to learn (almost the same amount as computer science). And there are not courses of the underlying knowledge about computer science (like computer network) Could you please give me some advice? Your words will be greatly appreciated!"
5198,Data Science Advice for College Students,"Hey there bro, nice video. But I'm still confused, like I'm an undergraduate student in CSE (Data Science) but I have no clue how to start things in programming and data science, so a little bit of advice please ? Because I probably can't do internship without having knowledge 😅😅."
5199,Data Science Advice for College Students,"I'm currently doing an undergrad in data science and engineering (in India), which I picked up impulsively. If that was a bad decision, would it be better for me to do a master's in computer science (hopefully from the US or Canada) to break into the data science?"
5200,Data Science Advice for College Students,"I noticed you talked about how a data science major is more watered down than a DS masters, and how majoring in one area of DS could be better. 
I’m currently choosing between majoring in CS at Penn State or data science at Purdue. Do you think the name recognition and internship opportunities at Purdue could outweigh the potential drawbacks, or should I just stick to CS at a less impressive school?

Also, the data science program at Purdue is relatively new, and students say many of the classes are similar to those a CS major takes. The main difference is that CS majors learn software engineering while DS majors learn statistics and data analysis.

Thanks,
Siyoung Kim"
5201,Data Science Advice for College Students,Thanks for the video sir. Im currently working on my masters degree in Statistics/Data science. Do you think it is likely I could get a job as a data scientist when I graduate? Or is it more likely i will need to start off as an analyst or something similar? Thanks again!

5207,Data Science Advice for College Students,"Hi Ken. First off, thanks for all the quality content you put out. I have a question after watching this and your boot camp vs certificate video.
I've got a physics work background with no degree. I'm looking to go back to school for a masters in physics in mind, but interested in combined/joint degree options. I'm leaning towards mathematics, but with the priority of CS towards Data Science, I might consider the later. Would a bootcamp be enough as long as I do my own projects and networking to keep DS an option, or would you strongly recommend the Phys/CS joint degree over the combined phys/math -> masters -> bootcamp option. I already have some programming history with a technology diploma and wouldn't mind the bootcamp. Thanks"

5210,Data Science Advice for College Students,Super helpful
5211,Data Science Advice for College Students,"Awesome channel! I am a rising Junior majoring in Data Science with a concentration in AI. I have always felt lucky that my school actually offers a Data Science undergrad program. But I also feel like school does not provide as much practical experience or project-based learning as internships do. However, getting an DS internship as someone who has only been in university for only two years is very difficult as well. They don't think you have the skills or enough practice (which is kinda true). Just a big vicious cycle."
5212,Data Science Advice for College Students,Is micromasters by edx (after undergraduaition)enough to get a internship or a entry level job( also including some kaggle projects)
5213,Data Science Advice for College Students,How much of CS do you actually need? I was planning to do a Math-Physics-Stats combo. Is it important to have a formal degree to progress forward? Because I was planning to do the entire coding part on my own without taking on site classes for that

Currently a Data Analytics undergrad student (after having done a Data Analytics bootcamp lol) this video has been an invaluable resource. I have a question regarding your second point of going back to grad school/not wanting to go back to school and still wanting to work in data science. Why do you consider Physics to be an integral part of learning in the field? I can see why one should study 'CS, Math, Statistics, or some other quantitative discipline', but hadn't thought of Physics and how it fits in the data science landscape. Interested in your thoughts. Thanks for your time!"
5236,Data Science Advice for College Students,"This was really useful. I’m currently dual majoring in mathematics and computer science with a minor in actuarial science. Would it be useful to go for a PhD in statistics, or is that overkill for data science?"

5244,Data Science Advice for College Students,"Hi Ken. Super helpful video! One thing that worried me was your second point as I am a 3rd data science major at UCSD and I am not looking to go back to grad school. I also don't have that much under my portfolio or much experience but I am currently working on personal projects on the side and applying to internships. I was wondering if you were in this situation, would there be any additional steps that you would take?"
5245,Data Science Advice for College Students,"Just got my master's degree in business analytics and your videos inspired me a lot! I hope I can watch your video before I applied for this program. My program was a two-year program covered R, tableau, JMP, Excel, supply chain and SQL. But I have not landed a job yet. To finish my program as soon as I can, I took summer sessions and didn't find an intern. After graduation, Some people say students with CS background is stronger and suggest me to start to learn python or java. Some say SAS certificates would help me get a job easily. What's your opinion about my situation?  Thank you Ken."
5246,Data Science Advice for College Students,"No doubt about communicating with professors to get an experience. I was able to get a machine learning research position as an undergrad at one of my CS professors' lab.

5248,Data Science Advice for College Students,"Thank you for this video! I have a nice video suggestion.
How to implement Data Science into a working business?
Let's imagine you have a business that produces refrigerators. One single small factory, a sales team, etc.
I know that Data Science can help make any process more efficient, let it be the energy consumption, the production itself, supply chain, sales, marketing, etc.
What could one do to implement data collection and data analysis in a company like this to analyze data and drive insights to make a business more efficient? What are some real-life examples, software names, etc? What is your related real-life experience?
I don't ask for a whole sophisticated tutorial, the basic overview kind of information would be enough, so a person from a non-technical background could learn how to implement Data Science in business.
Thanks a lot! I am your devoted fan. There are many channels out there but they don't cover Data Science as broadly as you are. You deserve many more views! I believe you will get them!"
5249,Data Science Advice for College Students,I am curious as to your opinion on these 3 month bootcamps that claim to have a job guarantee and claim that people get data science roles versus an 18-24 month masters program. I find it hard to believe a 3 month bootcamp would outweigh a two year program.
5250,Data Science Advice for College Students,"one thing which makes me really enjoy your content is how each video gets straight to the point, and that its summarised in the description. Thanks Ken Jee! :)"

5252,Data Science Advice for College Students,"Hi Ken, I want to pursue career in Data Science and I'm struggling with it. Though I'm in final year of undergraduate degree in computer science  but I haven't worked on real projects. I really have this passion and feel that I can do work but Argh ! I find myself stuck every single time.  Despite the fact that people appreciate me for 'Learning new things without hesitation' but I do not progress. I have been using online free resources about data analysis, machine learning for about two months but I couldn't progress from regression and classification. When I learn I deeply grasp a concept... and I've discussed this thing with my professor many times but I didn't get satisfactory answer. Am I missing something , doing wrong ? Or is it just I worry too much ?"

5267,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"Hi Ken - new subscriber here. Thank you so much for your words of wisdom. Was wondering if you'd have advice for someone in my situation: 

I'm currently a Data Analyst in a social media marketing agency and am looking to do an advanced degree in Data Science. Unfortunately, my non-technical background (I'm a liberal arts major who happens to be good at Math) means that I don't have the prerequisite undergraduate courses needed for Masters degrees in Data Science.

However, I fit the profile of some Masters in Business Analytics/Management Analytics degrees. These courses combine business concepts with coding components, with introductory overviews into ML & AI, but they're not deep, technical specializations. Was wondering if you'd say it would be a relatively smooth journey from a Business Analytics Masters degree to an eventual Data Scientist role?"

Great tips!!!"
5281,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"Well said Ken. Your delivery is more like a 'think-outside-the-box' than a cookie cutter approach. But since data scientists are not subject matter experts; then, the paradox of shape shifting as analyst or scientist might be the best way to thrive in a job landscape that's always in a flux."

I am a supply chain analyst kind of data analyst, there is a lot of opportunities for data science on this field, but not too many companies have data scientists. I am teaching my self Python and machine learning, I hope to make the transition to data scientist  one day."
5292,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"""Make sure your resume shows the type of value you've been creating at your current company or in your projects."" The latter is all the more reason to not give up hope even if one has a very poor work history with employment gaps."
5293,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,Hey man thanks for video. I am considering a career in data science and was thinking about taking a role as a data analyst just to get me started down that path.
5294,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,Great video Ken 🙌🏻
5295,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"Thanks, Ken for this video. Currently, I am looking forward to entering into any data science role so that I can get some work experience.

Which should one prefer first or choose first while applying for entry-level, data engineer or data analyst? As you told in one of your video about different job roles so data engineer comes first so I got this doubt."
5296,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,Looking forward to the podcast.
5297,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"Thanks for the great video Ken! This can definitely help me out because I'll be interning as a Data Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (tech stack is Python, R, SQL, and Tableau) for econometric modeling and I hope to use your advise for when I transition to either a more senior Data Analyst role past the entry level or even switch to become an actually Data Scientist once I go into industry :'))"
5298,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"This is a fantastic video, Ken. Great tips. Killing it 🙌🏻"
5299,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"So, what I got from this video is that after college I can start my career as  a Data Analyst too. I won't be hesitating if I'll be offered a Data Analyst role."
5300,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"Cool guide man, Im currently in uni going through a data science undergrad program and although Im learning really technical modeling and visualization tools, we really only apply them in a sanitized, scientific setting. Love the insights on DS in the workforce"
5301,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"Thank you for this video.  I am currently in a data analyst role, my boss told me the role is primarily for pulling reports, numbers and insights.  After I get everything done, I work on projects involving automation (we have crappy data structures and lots of manual processes), machine learning (specifically trying to forecast client spending numbers) and NLP (I work in a qualitative field so there are a lot of notes, so I used them for sentiment analysis).  I am hoping this will give me a good base to start applying to data science roles."
5302,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,I am trying to become a data scientist (in a specific focus area) and according to this list I can call myself a data scientist working using both R and Python. But I haven't felt comfortable calling myself a scientist before understanding enough statistics to make science. Most people are afraid to spend some time to understand statistics but from an employer point of view it's a big leverage.
5303,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,Great video👍
5304,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,Great video production Ken ! Thanks for the tips :)
5305,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"The question is how do I go from unemployed to Data Analyst? :(

Great tips, Ken. Thanks!"
5306,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,So insightful! Thank you for sharing your valuable knowledge with us. It was really helpful
5307,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,If I can do it then literally anyone can
5308,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"Great video Ken! Many useful tips here, specially for people trying to break into the space."
5309,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,You are doing great work man :D keep going ^^
5310,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"I expected an April 1st video trolling everyone somehow for 5 minutes and instead had to wait 1 more day to get actual useful and entertaining information 🙄.......🤣

Great video as always."
5311,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"The timming of this video is on point, just what I needed"
5312,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"Ken nearest Neighbours. So ""K means Business""."
5313,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"Well, now that I know how to switch to become a Data Scientist, I HAVE TO NOW!   Great insights as always Ken, I meet a lot of people that are interested in becoming a data scientist but don't consider trying out a data analyst first.  It's a great stepping stone to get you set up for success as a data scientist.  Keep up the content!"
5314,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"Perhaps one of the most important tip for transitioning to data science is to subscribe to Ken's YT channel and KNN podcast 😆The new video angle looks nice, the green dinosaur is very prominent 🦖"
5315,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"The creativity level when it comes your content is keep increasing .
Loving this such a great informative videoo💯🙌"
5316,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"Dude, your video intros crack me up every time."
5317,How to Go From Data Analyst to Data Scientist,"Good that you point out, that a Data Analyst is not inferior to a Data Scientist role. I work in as a Data Scientist in my company, but want to transition into a Data Engineer role, since I don´t really like the math part and want to write more code. You can always listen, a few weeks a product owner in my company said ""Damn our data pipelines crash our systems and we do not have a person who is experienced with spark and nobody is experienced with Scala. Bing bing... opportunity. I decided to do an ""Ultralearning"" challenge and see how much spark and Scala I can learn in 30 days. Lets see if that works out :-)."

5322,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,"It's so comforting to know, people like him with no phds and masters and years of working hard could land a job by just focusing on  for the next five months. Love this ken! Thank you so much"
5323,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,"I simp for this shirt ken, it looks great on you @.@"
5324,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,"I love the story about how he follows up with the CEO.  I never knew that was even a possibility to do, even though it makes total sense.  Great job."
5325,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,"Ken - Thanks a ton for the prompt response!  I figured I'd reply to your message in the new comment field - I've had difficulties posting replies to replies off comments in the past.  It's funny you mentioned a lawyer making the transitioned into the field.  Actually, I know a guy who made a virtually identical transition into a CS/DS related field.  Personally, I don't possess that sort of professional esteem.  I've worked a variety of jobs including tennis teaching pro/coach, commercial painting estimator, warehousing, etc.  Unfortunately, I never earned my Bachelor's.  While I came within range and have taken a series of biz-ad courses at a couple of comm colleges, I can't say that a degree is part of my repertoire.  
With all that being said, do you still think investing in a bootcamp would be the way to go?  Would it perhaps be better for someone with my set of circumstances to at least pursue an Associates in Biz with a concentration in D Analytics?  Indeed includes many Data Analyst positions where at least an Associates is preferred.  I've also read articles stating that holding a Bachelor's is virtually a necessity in terms of getting one's foot in the door as a data analyst.
Thanks again for your inspiring channel.  I look forward to combing through all of your videos as I attempt to traverse this arduous journey to becoming  a seasoned data scientist such as yourself."
5326,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,"Thank you for the insightful video.  I do have a few questions that have been lingering on my mind: would it be beneficial for a 36-year-old - who works full time - to at least pursue an associates in math and/or comp sci?  Perhaps blend that with taking edX/Data Quest/365 DSM?  I've been messing around with some Kaggle projects as well.  
Thanks again."
5327,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,Very insightful. I wish you could interview a family woman who succeeds in getting her first data science job.
5328,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,"Motivating update from future Ray to whomever is reading: I just got promoted to Lead Solutions Engineer!

5329,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,Is there anyway to get a recruiter to notice you if you dont have any aquaintance or friends who are recruiters?Thanks in advance
5330,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,"I'm doomed :(  I have experience as a business analyst, now Im learning SQL, but to be honest, I always go really bad at maths and logical exams. If they ask you to do these exams even with you proving that you can do the job, then I'm doomed. Really sad!"

5335,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,"Hey, what are the books mentioned around 31:44 by the speaker and Ken"
5336,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,"After watching this conversation and doing some careful consideration (including trying Datacamp vs. Dataquest) I ended up subscribing to a month of Dataquest and am really happy a  week in.  The context was that even though I had done a self-instruction path of working on projects, including for my current clients, I realized there were major holes in my fundamentals on both Python and R.  So even though I currently have projects I do every day using Pandas, R, and SQL, working in combination for real-world results, I was doing things like Leetcode and realizing my Python basics were really shaky.  Based on this interview in your video, and your feedback about value of looking for free resources vs. paying to have it all in one place, organized well, and with a good teaching tool, I opted to try this for a month.  I was immediately paid back with learning almost all of the exact things I had questions about or was missing in my current knowledge.  I was also very impressed with the curriculum on Dataquest and feel it is worth the monthly payments right now to very quickly acquire a base standard of data science knowledge that is in some ways 1:1 with current standard practices and knowledge.  Given your 66 days of data science challenge coming up, I think it was fortunate timing for my own ongoing efforts to pivot to this field from my current area of expertise, online programmatic ad ops.  Interviews like this really do provide a lot of value for those of us looking for answers and realistic, and honest, appraisals of solutions.  Thanks again!"
5337,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,This video was a huge shot of motivation. I've been using the past couple of months to begin my own journey towards working in the Data Analytics field since losing my job to COVID. This interview was extremely helpful in reinforcing some of the things I was already doing as well as making me aware of the things I wasn't. Congratulations to Ray on his success in breaking into the Data Analytics field and thank you to Ken for providing such helpful content in this area.

Thank you again for doing this."
5346,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,"I'm doing the Data Science Professional Certification by IBM on Coursera. What's your opinion on it? I really hope it's worth it. I'm at course 5 out of a total of 9. Started just 1.5 months ago and I'm overwhelmed by the amount of topics I need to learn. One thing that really bothers me is that I don't know how deeply I need to understand a particular topic. For example, python. Numpy, pandas, etc. How much of it is required to be able to work effectively with data? Any suggestions Ken?"

Thanks Ken."
5349,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,"What he said about ""not understanding Kaggle notebook"" is very relatable! I'm a software developer and I started taking interest in data science.
When I read other people's work on Kaggle the first time, I got discouraged because I didn't understand their thought process. As I started doing more courses online through Kaggle, taking other courses, and just playing around with some dataset, I slowly began to understand other people's work. 

All that is to say: be patient, keep learning and keep tinkering with datasets. It's a marathon not a sprint. You will be surprised by your progress. :)"
5350,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,Really insightful study. Learning on my own to be a data analyst. I got some inspiration and also how to go about my learning plan. 👍👍🙏

5372,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,"People are not able to start their careers in this field.

Companies are not ready to invest their time on new incoming talents instead they want the ones with the excellent skills set and experience in the field. While almost all the tech companies have their own Data Science departments, the others which do not have one, need a person with a lot of experience in this to start one.

What is your opinion on this Sir, Correct me and suggest me ?"

5375,How a Subscriber Landed a Data Analyst Job in Less Than a Year (Ray Ojel) - KNN EP. 09,Learning from other code examples is definitely very helpful in my opinion as well. Sometimes you just need to see a hands-on example of a function being used and it just clicks. Knowing someone on the inside surely is helpful and that my network is something I want to put in more effort into as well. Thanks for the review!

5388,How I Learned to Learn.,I think everyone should talk about how they learn and everyone should aim to get better at learning. Very helpful thanks
5389,How I Learned to Learn.,thank you for sharing your journey. It's super helpful for a c straight student in statistics like me. I've given up several time yet run to it again and again  through my work
5390,How I Learned to Learn.,Cool ideas. thanks Ken.
5391,How I Learned to Learn.,That wink tho
5392,How I Learned to Learn.,"14:03 ""...and the confusing success I was having with my gym habits now all became CLEAR"". Missed opportunity."
5393,How I Learned to Learn.,Thank you for taking the time to make this video and share it with us!
5394,How I Learned to Learn.,"Thanks Ken! Lesson 7 on projects is probably the most valuable one. That article you displayed, ""this will make you understand how hard data science really is"", is trapped by that fallacy: you can only be really really good at something if you know all the stuff about it. That's a very academic mindset and I found that in the real world outside college, it's not what you know, it's how well you can solve problems (aka finish projects). You don't need to know things from the top of your head if you have learned how to find and process information fast. If I had known that in university I probably would've been a lot happier and relaxed about my future."
5395,How I Learned to Learn.,Awesome !
5396,How I Learned to Learn.,awesome video!! I'll definitely try the speed reader and read the book recommendations!

5416,How I Learned to Learn.,"I see job postings on linkedin for data scientist roles that find MA degrees in Economics acceptable, I'm currently an undergrad studying Honours Economics and minoring statistics, while taking some courses in SQL, Python, and R. I am very passionate about Economics and for sure want to do a Masters, but am unsure whether to get a masters in Econ or Data Science as I feel Econ may not prepare properly for DS, but that Data Science would limit career opportunities.

1. growth mindset - belief you can improve. overcoming fixed mindset
2. his close friend passed away had him realize that life is short, and he should do something meaningful within short time given to him -> identify your purpose
3. overcoming ""imposter syndrome"" by self-talking with positive words.
4. decide your identity and you will behave according to your identity automatically.
5. just like a game, create proper environment for studying, set a clear goal, give immediate feedback to stay focused
6. practice how to read -> ended up enjoy reading -> helped studying
7. create a simple routine first -> add routines/habit gradually. busy you get, more efficiency in time consuming. 
8. there are vast areas you could study. your time & energy is limited. therefore, narrow it down to specific area you're really interested in, and dig into it."
5447,How I Learned to Learn.,"Ken, thanks for producing such a valuable content! I came across your channel about a months ago while searching videos about data science.

5467,7 Things to Look For in a Masters For Data Science (feat. @Tina Huang),"Matlab is still used a lot. It is not outdated. It just is not really for statistics and data science. It is still an important tool for engineers, the basic sciences and mathematicians. Still would not recommend it for data science, unless you expect to work in engineering and colleagues use it a lot. It is just too expensive to justify it, unless you know your employer will gladly pay for it (and all the separate toolboxes)."

5475,7 Things to Look For in a Masters For Data Science (feat. @Tina Huang),"A current master here: 30% comes from the uni as a big index along the courses you have and demanding you to pass the exams. 70% from really learning from other sources online.

Rankings are just marketing and must be ignored, look from pros and cons from the uni and the location to avoid surprises (especially as an international), get money from wherever you can as you will have enough stress from learning, and prepare in advance to reduce that 70% to save time and enjoy the journey."

5480,7 Things to Look For in a Masters For Data Science (feat. @Tina Huang),"Hello,
I am from India and i am currently in class 12th. Now i have this very big doubt on weather i should take B.Tec in CSE or AI. I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD. What my parents thinks that i should take CSE for B.Tec, coz if i don't like AI then i would not be left with more options, and what my side is, that i just love AI, like i literally love it. So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec. So i have this confusion of what to do in my B.Tec, can you please help me through this. It would be really a great help to me. My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it's a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?"

Another facet to consider is your actual life situation. I'm married, I own my home, and I live near my university, so that definitely influenced my decision. I didn't want to sell my home, move my family to a new town, and then pay out-of-state tuition.... but, OH, HOW I WISH I HAD 😂 This was a great video, Ken!!

Anyway, I am wondering that do we have take degree in data science major instead of other major? Because learning data science can be anywhere (online course, bootcamp) and learning the domains (energy, finance, health) are quite hard because we need facilities that we don't have.

How about my statement, Ken?"

5508,7 Things to Look For in a Masters For Data Science (feat. @Tina Huang),Great video! Do you have any videos about your experience at Depaul? I'm enrolling next year.
5509,7 Things to Look For in a Masters For Data Science (feat. @Tina Huang),"This is a good video. Tina's advice/input on course-based masters was definitely useful. I wish I knew about that going into my master's program. I'm doing research now that my professor plans to get published, but it took a lot of work to get to this spot. I don't know of any other master's student in my program doing research. Tina's right that generally, those opportunities are only available for undergrads and PhD students. I want to do an independent study in reinforcement learning to close out my last semester (next semester) but I already know that since I'm not a PhD student or curious undergrad, the chances of me getting that opportunity are slim to none. I'm hopeful that instead I might just continue to do research under the professor I'm currently working with. Course based masters definitely can be good, but it's also good to be aware of the possible cons that they can come with, and I think this video does a good job of explaining those pros and cons. I'll have to add this topic to the list of video ideas I got."

Currently doing my M.Sc. in Data Science with the university of London. I'm also working full-time and I will honestly not recommend anyone doing the program full-time while working full-time if you aren't already working in data science or have a strong base in the field. I'm in 4 classes this semester, and while I have a strong math background and comfortable programming in python, my programming skills are not the greatest and I am new to the Data Science field. I have found the time commitment to be a lot. Next semester I am definitely not taking more than 3 courses."

5524,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),Very good introduction on Kaggle. Truly learning by doing! I like that approach.
5525,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"Thanks for the vid ! nice ! 
I have a question apart. I did a dual boot windows/Ubuntu. But i want to switch 100% on ubuntu. Is it possible or i may loose my computer doing that ? (BTW do you have any tutorial for that) ?"
5526,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),Awesome! Thanks
5527,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"This is really comprehensive. All from scratch, that's what i wanted . thanks ken"
5528,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"00:50 ""It's nice for me to say that you should learn certain things or do certain things, it means a lot more if I can legitimately back those statements up with data.""
Much appreciated."
5529,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),I wish you'd been creating videos like this when I was learning data science! It would have saved me so much fretting and time.
5530,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),I've tried using the link that you showed us to download kaggle data sets but I still can't get it to be copied in the .kaggle folder that was made. I'm using Anaconda and am relatively new. Do you have any suggestions?
5531,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"Really helpful video, mate!
Thank you for providing the steps!
Been back and forth doing project from Kaggle and got stacked because don't know where to start questioning the data, and feeling guilty if I don't produce the questions by my own!

Super cool! Keep it up!"
5532,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),Been a while since I watched your videos been so busy.  Really great work getting to 114k man! I remember when I found your channel you were nearing 30k subs.  Keep making awesome videos!
5533,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"You probably already know this Ken, but in the terminal I use 'cd Doc' then tab complete.  It saves a few keystrokes for tired hands :D  

I'm excited to watch you complete this series!"
5534,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),I had no idea Kaggle did exploratory competitions! Thank you Ken!
5535,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),The cli typos are so relatable. I do them all the time. I use some Oh-my-zsh autocomplete extensions but the auto-suggestions can get problematic when I always write pyhton instead of python.
5536,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"Awsome. I am hooked with this chanel after i watched your Data science project from scratch. Other channel just write the code but Ken actually shows us the process. In the mean time, he gets error and he solved it real time. This kind of video is very helpful. Love it Ken... Please watch these kind of videos :)"
5537,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"Hey Ken Jee I did a bootcamp and my concept are now clear to someextent.
Now I want to skill up my problem solving skill.
How I can do that ?"
5538,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),can you please make a detailed tutorial on how to deploy the model using different methods (can make a playlist)
5539,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),This is awesome - Really insightful! Looking forward to the next part.
5540,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),Thanks Ken!
5541,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),Me coming from ForrestKnights video to try and get to the top of that comment leaderboard 😈

Great video, thanks for sharing! I'm just getting into Kaggle myself, love your approach and narration. One thing I'm curious about is best practices for version control in the local development workflow for Kaggle competitions. Looking forward to your next video!"
5543,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),love this because to this day i can't figure out kaggle lol
5544,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"Excited that everyone is so excited. Would be happy to follow along in other data tools with this project. I'm sort of a one man band at the moment so time is a constraint, due to this constraint I don't use R/Python as much as I used to instead I use data science tools like Alteryx and viz tools like Power BI/Tableau. Looking forward to follow along and try this out with a different toolset. 
Cheers"
5545,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"Hi thanks for the video just see you change to Linux instead of Windows
how good is it, what are pros and cons of this change?"
5546,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"Thanks for tuning in everyone! Get ready for part 2 coming 1/8! If you can't wait till then, I recommend checking out these other projects that I've done:

5548,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),Thanks! Very nice to be guided through a Kaggle comp. Greeting from Chile.
5549,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),I love this type of content. Great job :-)
5550,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"YES!!! I've been waiting for this project series for months!

Let #66DaysofData begin! :)"
5551,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"Great video Ken! This is probably one of the most important video in the series as it sets the stage for the entire data science workflow by implementing the list of questions formulated in this video. Like how you spend time explaining these essential before thoughts before diving into the coding. I haven’t yet done any Kaggle competition, might have just got inspired by your video 😆"
5552,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),this is a very helpful insight. I have seen a lot of videos of yours where you try and take inspiration from the works of others. I think that is how a Community grows!
5553,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),I love the projects videos
5554,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"just can't wait for part 2. You're the best YouTuber Ken. Love you, bro."
5555,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),Thank you Ken! Looking forward to part 2 and part 3
5556,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),Could we just for a moment appreciate the fact that we are doing data science to actually learn about data science!
5557,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),Love seeing similarities in how you start thinking about a project. I always find it interesting to see how others think and finding answers to questions through data or even finding “deeper” questions #DataGeek
5558,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"Hi Ken, can you please discuss how to structure a Clustering project? I just finished some classification and regression projects but I have no idea what to do for clustering. I can't find many resources online explaining clustering algorithms in a way that makes sense to me."
5559,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"Hi! Super newb question here for Ken Jee or anyone who cares to weigh in. :) I don't see a ""Join Competition"" button on this particular comp. Instead, it says to complete the Submission Form in order to participate. Is this normal and why is this happening? (Yes I'm signed in on Kaggle, and I see join buttons on other active comps.)"
5560,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),Thank you for your guide 👏 I really appreciate your dedication to what you do 🙂Wish you the best!
5561,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),Just try using Vaex library for your EDA
5562,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),Amazing start of the year Ken. I was wondering about your masterpiece playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t. Aren't you gonna do a similar full project on a different topic/dataset?

5578,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"will do this part of 66Days challenge :D
Question: do you have to use D3.js in your daily work?"
5579,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),I love how you just don't edit your mistakes out. It just shows that even the bests do silly things sometimes! You're inspiring Ken ♥️
5580,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"I am going to start master's data science course in coming September, in Cardiff University.  I think it has good modules at a decent fee. Do you think my decision is correct? Because there is still time left to amend the decision."
5581,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),Yayyy something new and interesting just before I start my grad school!!!
5582,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),First one!
5583,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"Hey, Thank you for sharing amazing content with us. It's really helpful."
5584,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 1 (Data Science Profession Survey),"Hey Hey, Its been a while..Back with something great"
5585,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,If u copy someone’s work ur just cheating yourself
5586,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Thank you Ken as always! Just going to post my first project and yes I am going to cite everything. Contrary, I feel good giving credit because the project helped me a lot to learn. And I should write a para about how A YouTuber named Ken Jee is helping me for free without asking for any credits :p. Thank you. You made my day I hope this comment makes yours :D"
5587,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Great video sir, I want to know how exactly can we cite others work if we used their work in our projects?"
5588,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"We need ""fork"" button on arxiv 😂"
5589,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Thanks for sharing. I want to know what kind of projects should be done in order to get Data Analyst/Business Analyst roles?
5590,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Happy I learned how to properly document code from your by scratch series!  Was a big help.
5591,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,This happened to me too.
5592,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,I hope you read this bro.. the course 365 data science that you had described in your vlog information is showing only 20% discount not 47% can you check on this TIA.
5593,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Plagiarism can't exist in the IT world. If you have a dataset and you need get some data out of it.. there are maybe 25 solutions. Even if people don't know each other they can have the same solution and or have the same way of writing code. In the past i had idea. Didn't talk about it or publish it. I was working on it and about 2 years later(was not done yet) a big company came with the same thing.. I have tried to prove that i came with the idea first. But it didn't held up in court.
5594,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"I love the new lighting, really ups the professionalism of the channel"
5595,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"I care very much about getting and giving due credit as it is about humility. Giving credit is hard, especially if that person will get ahead faster than I will. Getting credit is hard because it depends on other people giving credit!"
5596,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Hey, Ken! I hope this situation didn't hurt you too much. I see a lot of people who are trying to catch a job with any methods and doesn't think about consequences of theirs actions. I think it's kind of struggle for survive.  So don't be upset, we are with you ;)"
5597,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Thanks for the video, I have two questions though if someone don't mind answering 
1. Let's say I did a project without knowing someone else on the net did something similar to my projects, is it plagiarism ?

2. And if I get ideas from some others projects but codes are not copied at all ? Is it plagiarism ? Or what if I got inspiration from a project but did something completely different from what that project is ? Should I even cite the resources I got the inspiration even though the project is different ?"
5598,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"The same things happen in other branches of science, or probably worse. Intellectual rights of an ordinary people are never respected."
5599,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,You mean to say that plagiarism isn't wrong but not giving credits to the source is wrong  ?
5600,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Elon musk said that when we go to the depth of the problem and ask questions and slowly the layer unveils than we truly know whether the person has truly done it or was just part of the major project.
5601,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Hi Ken, if I copy snippets from your notebook where exactly do I give you credits? In the first cell of my notebook or the last one? And do I just mention your name or do I also add a link to your notebook?"
5602,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Me too...
5603,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Hello Ken, how can a beginner like me get the most out of GitHub?. I want to enter the data analytics job field one day and I have been doing self-learning."
5604,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,I’m gonna plagiarize that haircut
5605,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Great clarification Ken. Not only for Data Scientists but also for other professions. In the world we're living today plagiarism is easy to do and I believe that most people do it without realising so clarifying this is important 👍
5606,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Thank you very much Ken. Very valuable lesson!
5607,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Dear Ken, am sorry to hear about this.

The saddest thing is that those who indulge to plagiarism do not understand that this practice tends to damage themselves, and you rightly highlight this aspect.

If we want to strive for excellence, then we must unveil the logic and try hard on our own. Plagiarism does give one the opportunity to feel knowledgeable for one day, but in the long term it will likely show how miserable one is.

The question is, how might we seek out whether we have been plagiarized? 

The topic of plagiarism concerns youtube too. Do you want evidence?
Just look around and see how many times people post videos using copyrighted material. Soccer is one of the many examples. Or TV/radio programs. People merely do NOTHING and try to get visibility - and even money - using other's effort.

I recently had a quarrel with another guy who said, ""You can wipe your axx with the Ethics. In youtube world this makes no sense.""
Welcome to the 21th century guys."
5608,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Glad you made me clear about this issue. While learning from notebooks in Kaggle and other sites I feel so low to use someones codes. But I see this is common and a quite learning approach. The thing that I shouldn't do is just not publish it as my own . Thank you for clearing up my thoughts.
5609,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Sir I have a bid confusion in field.of data science so please can you provide me your mail ID?
FOR THAT in will be grateful to you"
5610,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,How did you find out that he copied ?
5611,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,awesome video!!
5612,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Hello all and Mr. Ken Jee,

It is very humble of Mr. Ken to just have a light eye the  person who copied his work. I am a learning individual myself. I do visit kaggle and github but to just get an idea of how the person has solved the problem and then i take almost one to two weeks to come up with my own unique solution. Solving takes time. Learn from elders and create something on your own. Again Mr. Ken is being very much liberal here. But you will face a big issue when you go for Masters or research jobs. You will get caught and it won't look good. One other thing that Mr. Ken did not address of course he doesn't want to scare the young ones is that a company hold power to blacklist you after being caught of fraud. This means that you won't be able to apply for that company for upto 3 years or forever depending on the policy and also the company can suggest your blacklisted profiles to partner organizations and you will be totally **screwed**. 

Shadow learning is something very important to learn. Shadows learning suggests learning the first principles from others works . This means learning the thought process and not copying the core work. Most of the researchers have 2 ways of reaching a new success. One is making something better or creating something new. Shadow learning is something Einstein has done it himself. He worked as a clerk in a patent office for years going through the research papers or maxwell's , newtons , etc. Did he copy ? Absoluetly not. When he found out that he was a bit lagging in the math section of E=MC^2 he contacted maxwell for his expertise on the derivations. That's how we have Einsein-Maxwells Equation. See. Einstein himself wasn't shy of giving credit to the fellow scientists. Why should kids like us be shy of mentioning a partner or co worker or the sources name or the persons name ? 

Have an open mind like newton. Let the apple fall and create something new. 

Cheers and All the best . 
People are good but people who share credits are  great.
Peace!"
5613,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,I finished IBM's Data Science specialisation course on coursera few weeks ago. The capstone project is peer-graded. I can assure you that there were plenty of  students who simply copied and uploaded others' work. It was utterly disgusting.
5614,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Thanks a lot for bringing up a serious topic! Plagiarism can easily happen when coding and you pointed out very important stuff. Hopefully people have a better understanding of plagiarism now!
5615,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Love how you always get straight to the point! So sorry to hear that this happened to you. Would you even write the source if you got some code from Stack Overflow? I probably should start doing that huh...
5616,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Hi Ken, would like to know your host configuration for the machine learning"
5617,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"With Siraj the real nail in the coffin was how badly he plagiarized that deep learning paper by replacing mathematical words with nonsense words (complicated hilbert spaces, haha). I understand why people lie when there's little chance of getting caught. I don't understand when people do it in a situation where they will almost certainly be caught."
5618,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Bravo 👏👏👏
5619,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Love the dramatic beginning hahaha already know it's going down 
It's great you took such an ambiguous topic and broke it down with rights and wrongs. Really important to highlight the consequences too. Great video!"
5620,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Thanks for clearing that up Ken that’s sucks man. It really is important even when following your guides here on YouTube that you get the credit you deserve!
5621,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Hey Ken, I'm very new to programming. I followed along with your Glassdoor Project (reproducing it for the UK). I attempted every section myself before looking at the approach you took for each step of the DS pipeline. But when I was stuck (As this was my first end to end DS project -  this happened a lot) I referred back to what you did. Here is a link to my repository: https://github.com/TobiAdeniyi/glassdoor_proj

Is the referencing Okay??
The results in the table are in question marks because it takes ~1 hour to run all the models."
5622,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,DS loves pandas and set it as background! Maybe green color helps to protect your eyes.
5623,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Time
5624,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"This is a pretty insightful topics in terms of originality regarding projects. Now in terms of the ""finding the same dataset someone used and using different algorithms to do some analysis"", wouldn't that also kind of include people using common datasets from Kaggle in that case since it's the biggest source for data science projects?"
5625,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"I think some of this comes from being badly informed on proper protocols for giving credit (just because something is freely available on Github doesn't mean it's free for anybody to just grab as their own with no strings attached), and poor mechanisms for dealing with the understandably great pressure some face in the field.   Doesn't make it right, though I agree with you that I doubt it typically comes from ill intentions.

On an unrelated note.... I think it's ""sy-kit learn"", not ""sick it learn"".   ""Sick it learn"" sounds like a modern experimental metal band or something ;)"
5626,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"I have a question in regards to your work being original and you having the ability to do it yourself and that being important to employers. So with the web scraper example, would you say that an employer would say that you maybe don't know how to do that? Would they rather you go through and write it out fully yourself, which would've substantially increased the length of that project. And of course, you knew it well enough to modify it. And I will be clear, I am not saying that you should copy it without giving any credit. But if you did what you did, would an employer say you don' t understand. I hope that made sense... Thanks, I appreciate your channel!"
5627,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"If I did want to site your work from your data science project from scratch video, what exact steps would I have to take? Like what is the format for citing work?"
5628,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Hello, I am from Iran. Could you please guid me to learn a programming  language to find a job In Canada?"
5629,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,I had no idea you get more credit having shared that you are using non-original sources. Super counter intuitive at first— but makes sense
5630,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Ken- great example of how handling a problem maturely brings you a net benefit.

Let’s assume you freaked out, put this guy on blast— and moved on.

You’d feel worse, and I (VERY green data scientist trying to learn the ropes) wouldn’t have learned this valuable lesson!

Your ability to calmly walk through the pros and cons helped out a lot of beginners— and I’m sure you feel better having taken mature action."
5631,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Would be great if you went through a project showing how to site work etc ... later down the road showing best practices.
5632,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,While I think it is an important conversation I should point out that most of what you described is not plagiarism. It is more intellectual property violations.  I think technologists have become so accustomed to software reuse that the lines have been blurred. I agree with the principal of your commentary just pointing out the legal distinction in hopes of focusing the discussion into the appropriate arena  of IP and open source licencing.  Thank you for your content I do enjoy watching it.
5633,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"So if I used someone else’s algorithm with totally different datasets, I should cite the person on my project right?"
5634,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Finally somebody called it out. Thanks
5635,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,You mean you got sirajed 😉
5636,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Great topic and good video. I think you set the appropriate tone overall.
I believe most people learn by copying/following along/mimicry (whatever it is called) at first. I know that I have reproduced projects for the sake of learning. Now when I follow along with someone's project I find it REALLY helpful to state where it came from on top. This way I know where it came from and can return to the original material later if need be. 
My personal thinking is that many, many, many (did I say 'many' enough) people forget the internet is open, to a fault."
5637,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"This is a very important topic, I agree!
As you have said, using someone else's code is very common in DS or just tech in general,
however it is important to credit the people correctly.
Some people may think ""I could have written that code myself"", which can of course be true in some situations,
but I like to think that using code is at least somewhat comparable to quoting in literature.
If you use a normal sentence such as ""the weather was nice"" obviously you don't need to quote anyone.
But if you want to use a longer paragraph of text (or code, in that matter) it is very important to show the source.
Now in literature this is made pretty easy by placing quotation marks and just referencing the author but because code
stays below the surface in many areas plagiarism can go unnoticed for far longer, even though it is not less important to credit people in
tech than it is in literature.
Thank you for making this video and bringing a bit of light onto this topic, I think this is something which should be made very clear!

Edit: When writing I just noticed that it makes a lot of sense for one's self to give proper credit as well. As you said it makes people happy to see their code being used well. So if you give proper credit you not only make yourself feel good, because you did the right thing, but also the creator, because their work was used and they got credit. On the other hand, if you don't credit, you feel bad for plagiarizing and the other person becomes angry because of it. So giving proper credit is basically a win-win!"
5638,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Thanks for watching everyone! To clear things up, the work of mine was copied in an article that was published on a blogging website that you can make money off of. If someone simply has this in their repo, that is not as big of an issue, but it should be cited there if they are applying for jobs. Plagiarism is a serious issue in data science. Hopefully this could help clear things up!"
5639,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Thank you ken! I know how you fell
5640,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,do you pop a Xanax before every video?  Have some inflection in your voice
5641,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Thanks for the info bro...
5642,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,Thank you ❤️
5643,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"what do you think is the future of Data Science jobs? Will jobs remains with all this autoML,pretrained model etc and so many people getting training in ML?"
5644,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"Thank you for this informative video Sir, this is truly helpful to young inexperienced present and soon to become data scientists such as myself. As far as plagiarism goes with respect to code I have a question. I'm sure that even on the internet there are some niche, common and popular data sets which are considered to be the kind of must do's for new data scientists. In such a scenario its probable that 2 entirely different unrelated and isolated data scientists decide to use the exact same methodology to analyze the data, in such scenarios how should one go about giving the due credit to the people who have already employed similar if not the same method for analysis? 
Additionally on a completely unrelated note I have a school level (class 11th and 12th, high school) coding competition coming up comprising of 2 rounds. The first one being questions related to coding and java, python and c++ and the 2nd round being solving 3 real world problems using code under the span of 1 hour. The second round is purely python coding based. I only know vanilla python well (most of the general functions and methods) and have no experience with either java or c++. I was thinking of learning some modules I've briefly learned the foundations of throughout high school such as numpy, math, csv and either pyqt5 or tkinter. Do you have any tips for me that could help me win this competition? Its my first coding competition and I want to test myself against other coders from other schools and most of all see if my efforts have borne fruit. Any tips or other modules I should revise or learn would be extremely helpful.
Finally I have one last question, I've researched this quite a bit on both YouTube and the internet through articles but I haven't found any satisfactory answer to a question. What's it like to be a Data Scientist, I'm not asking the work schedule or when a DS wakes up what he/she does at the start of the day and then what they do at work and after returning home what work do they do related to DS. I want to know what is a data science life in general, what do you do on off days, how much ""me"" time do you get, what kind of holidays do you get to connect with friends and families and just take it easy and take a break from work. I'm eager to know the ""life"" side of work life balance with regards to being a data scientist.
Sorry if the comment is a bit too long, its just that for me you are the only working professional and mentor figure I can ask these kinds of questions. I'll be really glad if you respond. And again, thank you for making these videos, they are a huge help."
5645,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,"It's nt a issue until and unless they are using ur codes in learning channels and earning money. 
Becoz ultimately even if they get DS/DA jobs by showing your codes they will definitely struggle to carry out data scientist role and threw out of organization 🙂"
5646,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,One of the first things I look for when interviewing data scientist is whether their work is original. Great video!

5729,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,Hi I am a Data Science student at university and love your videos. You should definitely create/release a template for notion. I use a variety of different software and platforms to capture and manage my data and am really interested in consolidating.

5732,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,"I had always been intrigued about data and how it impacts our life as a part of my job was a HR Professional. And during the lockdown I spent a good amount of time on reading and finding out more about Data. So much so that now I am taking up the Google Data Analytics Course on Coursera. I have been tracking my daily habits, physical exercise patterns and writing schedules for almost 6 months now. And now I think I can use this data to build a personal project or projects for my Data Analytics course. Thank you for sharing your inputs about your daily habits and how you track them. I generally work with spreadsheets and Apple Calendar / Notes. Have not tried other apps as yet."
5733,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,Hey ken I just stumbled on to the field of data analytics cause I hate too much coding 😂 and came across your page and several others and this is literally calling out to me. I do have some thing I wana  ask you I’m currently taking google analytics professional certification course on coursera and they teach R instead of python. Is it absolutely necessary for me to learn python and what’s the diff between R and python? Could you give me a basic idea. Also is this google certificate worth it would it be easier landing a job with it. Sorry if I’ve asked too much but you’re very responsive on here unlike others and I would like to hear your opinion.
5734,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,You stop drinking coffee after 2pm? Nice job. Was it hard at first?

And it looks pretty nice though.  
Even Before too I wanted to take a look at that.
But , now I know it's a real deal.
Btw great videos Ken on how to keep track of yourself. 
I always thought of doing something like that but haven't done it with Structured data on paper."
5739,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,Hi Ken. Thank you for this great video and for sharing your experience. I'm tracking my data since 2012 and it has been very helpful for me. And I have many ideas of how I can use that data. So I will stay tuned of course.
5740,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,This is awesome @Ken. Would love to see your notion templates for tracking your habits!
5741,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,"😶 My surprised face that Ken Jee uses dark mode for Notion ... 
Also, I just switched to Notion a few weeks ago and I LOVE IT.  It has revolutionized the way I track my daily tasks and notes. 10/10 would recommend!"
5742,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,"hah - the main thing I track on myself is my menstrual cycle.  I took a break from it for a while when my husband got snipped, but i started up again when I started hoping my cycle would stop.  which has been 5 years already.  

When i first started tracking my cycle, though, I also tracked acne and moods - and i was taking my temp every day, as part of cycle tracking, which also helped me track illnesses.  That was actually pretty cool.  

My ob-gyn's nurse laughed at me when I brought in a chart of my cycle dates and lengths."
5743,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,"That's really awesome,  really had the same idea, but my problem is collecting data, tracking it"

5745,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,"WILL THERE be upcoming videos on collecting, and more important extracting, time management data in Notion in order to analyze it? Dorie Clark has an interesting article in FastCompany (""I painstakingly tracked everything I did for a month. Here’s what I learned"") but the ""painstakingly"" in the title IS an obvious hurdle. LOL It defeats the purpose when ""time tracking"" becomes a major task in an of itself."
5746,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,"Absolutely notion is really amazing. Though I don't have great template but I am keeping tracks of the books which I am reading and my college work using notion. Thank you so much for sharing, Ken. I will love to see your template in coming days!"
5747,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,Thanks Ken! I would love to see a notion template.
5748,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,Nice video Ken! I like how you’re investigating your life’s metrics to better understand your productivity. Currently your equation is “Tasks = f(Habits)”. What if the number of papayas eaten in a day increases? “⬆️Tasks = f(Habits + nPapayas)”  🤔
5749,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,"Woohoo🙌 Sponsored video... Grt🤘

You told me Ken that you will share your Papaya 🍋 story 😅 Any plans?"

Questions:
1) How much time did it take for you to set up as well as how much time do you spend on Notion daily/weekly?
2) How would you compare Notion to simply dealing with the MacBook's ""Notes"" or any notepad, and even Google calendar?"

Feels a bit weird to be done with school but now I'm starting a new chapter in life. While I'm starting out as a statistician at a biotech company, I hope to move into Data Science in the coming years.

5756,How I Use Data to Optimize My Life | What I Collect & How I Analyze It,"Very interesting material! Thank you for that! 

One thing that struggles me and I think might be the less comfortable one is that you have to introduce the the data, daily, by yourself (Notion scenario). Am i right?
Is there a manner through which you automate that?

5785,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"I am sorry, 256G of hard drive for data science ?  I really think you should do a few data science projects before you start recommending these specs.  256G even for a regular system might not be enough (even considering the fact that lot of data is stored in cloud).  For data science you should be looking at TBs of hard drive space."

5792,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Hi Ken Jee! I have a macbook pro 16 2019 but i need it to work with Power BI and Power Query. I am struggling with that. I may probably need to buy another computer. What do you suggest?
5793,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Hey, could you make a vid explaining how to get a gpu in the cloud in your laptop, I have all specs but my gpu is integrated."
5794,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Hey ken. I know it's  a off topic for this video but I only know you an IT expert who can answer my questions. I want to learn android development . I am already a web developer. But I am not sure if I need a computer science degree to become a android developer. So can you tell me do I need a computer science degree in order to become a android developer or can become a self-taught android developer.
5795,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"A quick question
Is it possible to run CUDA on an AMD CPU ? (Yes *CPU* , not talking about GPU)"
5796,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,I bought a $699 Lenovo IdeaPad flex 5 laptop as i was a newb and didn't know about the gpu requirement. This one has an AMD Radeon gpu. I have the option to cancel the order. Should i cancel it?
5797,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Nice home exterior view u have.
5798,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Thanks for the content Ken but SSD stands for solid state drive not stead(y).
5799,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,켄지 짱!
5800,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Hey Ken,
How do you go about classifying data as unknown aka outside the distribution that the training classes fall into? My neural net softmax probs are high for data that should be unknown"
5801,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"I've got a Ryzen 7 computer with 32G RAM and NVIDIA 2080 Ti, since I'm going to almost exclusively work with neural networks. My professor has 128G RAM and claims that isn't enough for the real-life tasks :)
I don't really like Colab for the serious work. First, the session expires pretty quickly, and you should fall to the shameless tricks to keep it. Second, transferring gigabytes of data for training via Internet may nullify all the advantages of TPUs. Colab is great for the small learning or experimental projects, but it can't train a BERT-based network that required more than a day on my 2080 Ti."
5802,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Ken Jee, tell me please! SSD on SATA 3.0 for what kind of work in data science we can use? And for SSD on NVMe the same question) hope you understand what do i mean) Thanks a lot for your videos, interesting to listening to you!"
5803,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Thanks, Ken, for this! You're simply amazing!"
5804,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Please upload more data science project as well like krish naik 😁😁😁
5805,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Ken, Thanks for another quality video! This is a golden piece of advice on the million dollar question. The 3 tier starter specs are really useful starting point for building our own PC. Currently most of my work are down on my MacBook and run on the cloud. Will definitely, re-watch this video when I actually go and build my own PC."
5806,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Nice guidance Video.
Video quality is increased so greatly."
5807,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Sir, I request you to interview Joma Tech"
5808,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"I recently switched from a Hewlett Packard Spectre 13 (8 GB RAM, 1 TB M.2 2880 SSD, Intel i5) to a Lenovo ThinkCentre M700 (16 GB RAM, 512 GB SATA III SSD, Intel i5-6400T) for data science. The impetus for the migration was my need for an ergonomic keyboard because modern notebook computer keyboards are terrible for extended typing sessions. Eventually, I will add an NFS server providing easily expandable file storage but that is likely a project for next year as part of a larger re-architecture project for my home office network and computing hardware."
5809,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"a year ago i built a computer for ML and DL , Thanks Ken , another great video as usual"
5810,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Awesome video ken, just a quick note there , it would have been HDD and not HHD :p. Else it was yet again a great watch"
5811,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Tell me more about that usb-c graphics card tech for laptops.
5812,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Thank you so much Ken for your awesome videos
5813,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Hey, Ken. I'm using Asus Vivobook. What can you say about it? Thanks"
5814,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"I found this video to be extremely basic and vague (and the video doesn't quite match the contents: you show very expensive components and then speak how it's not really necessary to have powerful PC for beginners). The general recommendations are fine, but there is no explanation as for when and why you would want to get anything better than Ryzen 5.

What tasks are particularly CPU focused, and will benefit noticeably from e.g. Ryzen 9 processor? If it can save you several hours of computing a day, it can be a big deal, but if it says less than a hour, it's mostly pointless.

The same goes for graphic card. Nvidia RTX Titan seems extremely overpriced for what it does. From what I can tell, it's only slightly better than RTX 2080 Ti, and cots twice as much. Is there even any reason to get it? Maybe some additional optimization for Data Science tasks? So far it looks extremely cost ineffective, even for highest end PC. Might as well get something cheaper for now and then upgrade to RTX 3000 when it launches.

Again, unless it can save several hours of computing every day, I don't see how it makes any sense at all.

Additionally, I wonder how impactful RAM memory speed is for Data Science tasks. Does it make sense to overclock your RAM, or is it just a waste of time and effort?

Finally, I'm not sure if it's correct to simply ignore Motherboard and PSU (You listed a 500$ PC, and then you mentioned 200$ for motherboard and other components, which practically increases the price by 50%). Again, depending on how important storage speed is, it might make sense to get a more expensive motherboard, such as B550 or X570. However, if it's not as important, and regular NVME SSD is more than good enough, then good B450 board is plenty powerful. As for storage Samsung NVME SSDs are way overpriced, so I wouldn't recommend one personally. Good ADATA NVME costs just 70-75$ for 500 GB, and is only marginally slower.

My recommended budget build based in my understanding will depend on the country, but in short here doesn't seem to be any significant differences from general gaming build recommendations.

For processor I'd get Ryzen 5 1600 AF if it's available for under 110$, otherwise Ryzen 5 3600 is the best choice.

For memory if speed is not super important for Data Science tasks I'd recommend Crucial Ballistix Black 2x8 GB 3200 MHz. Even if it is this kit has good overclocking capabilities. Wouldn't get anything below 16 GB, as Chrome is a memory hog, and you likely need a lot of tabs open for data science projects.

For motherboard I'd recommend B450 Mortar Max or Tomahawk Max, as those support upgradability. For cheaper options B450 PRO-VDH Max is also good.

For SSD ADATA SX8200 Pro 500/1000 GB is the best choice (depending on your preferences regarding regularly cleaning your PC). I wouldn't get anything below 500 GB myself, since this will likely cause major inconveniences.

For PSU anything 550-650W is good enough. I wouldn't get anything below Gold certification if your PC runs for 10+ hours every day. If available at reasonable price, Deepcool DQ-650M is a good choice.

Monitor doesn't really matter for Data Science, so anything cheap and sturdy will do.

Graphic card is a tricky one. I'd probably try to look for a good used option for a budget build, but it's hard to find a reliable seller. I assume Nvidia cards are easier to use for Data Science, as AMD cars get less support. Used GTX 1060 6GB is a bare minimum I'd recommend, but if you can afford a more expensive one, 2070 Super looks like an optimal choice in terms of cost to performance. Personally I'd get 1060, and then upgrade to RTX 3070 when available.

As for the case, anything above 60$ should be fine. Got myself new MSI MAG case, it's quite, runs pretty old and comes with fans already pre-installed. More premium options are Phantex P400A, and Meshify C.

Secondary components like motherboard, PSU and case may seem unimportant, but they ultimately affect performance, reliability, upgradability and longevity of the system as we.

Still would like to know how important memory speed is for Data science tasks. 16 GB 2400 MHz and 16 GB 3800 MHz are 2 completely different kits for some tasks."
5815,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Great video ken . Keep them coming.
5816,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"This video came at the perfect time! I’m leaving for grad school soon doing an MS in Data Science and Analytics, and my laptop is about 10 years old and hella slow. I desperately need a new one but as a student I don’t have the budget for another Apple product."
5817,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Thank you ken :-)
5818,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"That GPU looks like a monster :O
Can't imagine the performance difference with that!"
5819,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Have you considered doing a video discussing the different operating systems? Lots of conflicting opinions between Windows, Mac, and Linux and very few resources for data science specifically. Would be great to hear your opinion on this matter"
5820,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Can you show us how to get/use GPU resources from online such as Amazon service or Google platform?
I tried, but felt a little hard"
5821,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Hey Ken, how're you? Great video once again :)
Apart from MacBook and Dell XPS what are the other laptop suggestions you have?"
5822,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,The video I've been waiting for! I'ma save some money and go for the mid tier one as I wanna get back into gaming!
5823,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Great video. 

I have question.. Can i practice Deep learning using Google colab/ kaggle notebooks?"
5824,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Ken, what about the keyboard? I see you're using a Durgod Hades 68. Do you think a mechanical keyobard is worth the investment? Also, do you think that a TKL keyboard work just fine for doing data science?"
5825,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Great content as usual, thank you for your insight!"
5826,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Great video! Always informative.
5827,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"AMD Ryzen series is awesome, I just rebuilt with that and an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT. Absolutely awesome."
5828,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Thanks for making this video Man ...!! I have  never own a Laptop or system before it's more helpful to understand the requirements of a system....! Actually I'm also planning to buy a Laptop for learning DS big thumbs up to u man.....! But the problem is there is no such laptops under the price range of 500 $ with the specs u would mention in the video 😔😔 could u pls suggest some if u don't bother abt the mentioning......!
5829,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"For beginners, go with what you have. Of course it is nice to have high specs, but to get started you dont need that much power. You can do pretty much anything on kaggle, googlw colab, or native jupyter notebook. If you get professional enough, you will need what kind of computer you need. 

For much of data cleaning and learning and linear regression, average computer is just fine. You dont need nvidia cuda cores for that. Waste of money for beginning."
5830,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Nice content Ken 👍
5831,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Great video, I have a gaming pc build that I use but yours if one of the first I’ve seen on DS PCs"
5832,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Hi Ken,
Could you do a video (or videos) on machine learning on the cloud? I see GCP, Azure and AWS have a lot of services that help you setup your ML environment on the cloud. I believe this is going to be the future where creating a ML pipeline using cloud services is going to be crucial considering that the data usually exists on the cloud and training on the cloud is cheaper that racking up physical resources."
5833,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Thanks Ken for this informations.🙂
5834,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,that slow transition into tech review for data science ;) I see you Ken
5835,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"I have only been looking at DS for two years but I built my first PC at 11 in 1994 and I did it professional for a while, so I know I have built and setup at least 5000 computers. I would choose a Mac with parallels, without a doubt. Then you can use OSX, Windows and Linux. I won’t go into specs, since I do a lot of 3D modelling in Inventor I know I set the limit quite high."
5836,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,Thanks for this video!
5837,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"How about Apple Mac Book Pro ??  I am planing to buy , is apple laptop is good for data science  ?? any suggestion please. Thank you :)"
5838,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Now you are just spamming random basic videos that are literally everywhere on the YouTube.  Also, most of your audience probably heard about RAM before... Think little bit about your audience, we might have seen a computer prior to clicking on your Subscribe button."
5839,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,"Thanks for watching everyone! I hope this video was helpful to you. If you're new to data science, I recommend watching this new playlist I just put together: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs . I took all of the best videos I made for beginners and threw them in here!
If you just want to jump into my recommendation you can skip to 2:50!"
5840,Don't Buy My Course..,Title had me for a moment
5841,Don't Buy My Course..,it said 92 percent discount and i purchased it :)
5842,Don't Buy My Course..,Hey ken...what is your opinion about moving from data analyst role  to  more of manager role...also  how many  years of work experience should one have before the transformation(Is 2-3 years sufficient)?
5843,Don't Buy My Course..,"Ken: 'Don't but my course...'
Me: Went ahead and purchased the course during watching the video!"
5844,Don't Buy My Course..,Does the course contain end to end projects? Or it's just on how to build your portfolio and how to behave in a data science interview and what should you expect?
5845,Don't Buy My Course..,loving your channel a lot ken! will definitely take your course once I brush up on basic skills and knowledge. keep it up man!
5846,Don't Buy My Course..,"Thanks for updating the discount, unfortunately there is no way to buy it. The order form is not active."
5847,Don't Buy My Course..,"I put this message here, since it's your last video. I was wondering if you will do a video on the following subject:

How to interact on kaggle to attract the attention of other people, the kind that are helpful and, likewise, how can a newbie, like me, make a contribution ourselves as beginners on kaggle.
And in general, what are the best ways to interact on the platform. 
I ask because I believe finding some form of mentor-ship from experienced people is one of biggest key or advantages you can get in learning any field, but ML in particular ( your youtube videos and frank kane courses from sundog are good example). 
Of course, gaining some kind of a more direct mentor-ship goes hand in hand with yourself being able to help and make contributions in return (which seems the whole philosophy being kaggle) so I was wondering if you would be willing to share a few secrets there. ( I fully admit that it looks a bit intimidating at first sight :) ).

In any case, thanks for your youtubes videos :)"
5848,Don't Buy My Course..,"There is something wrong with your promotion. The yearly price is only 20% off, please correct and update"
5849,Don't Buy My Course..,"Your wholesome click-bait worked ! Just purchased your course on Udemy, it was on sale for $10. Thanks for making such a great resource. Cheers !"
5850,Don't Buy My Course..,"Watch on 1.25 speed thanks, great content :)"
5851,Don't Buy My Course..,Is competitive programming good for data scientist and if someone has participated into it and got a good result so can he mention that in his/her resume?
5852,Don't Buy My Course..,"So much respect for you, Ken! You are being transparent instead of hard selling like everyone else."
5853,Don't Buy My Course..,"Judging by the amount of effort you put into organizing your thoughts and ideas and displaying them in your videos, I can tell you would make an excellent lecturer."
5854,Don't Buy My Course..,Thank you Ken for your contents. I recently got 365 data science course with your discount link😁 because I noticed some basic knowledge gap from learning in an unstructured manner. I hope to polish my skills and get a job before the year winds up. Thank you!
5855,Don't Buy My Course..,Thank you for being brutally honest. Respect.
5856,Don't Buy My Course..,"Hey ken, if you ever plan to make videos teaching data science concepts or any sort of tutorials but you are struggling with time, try live streaming. It will save so much time of yours since you don't have to edit them  + you can interact with us guys more often."
5857,Don't Buy My Course..,"Hi, ken. I really like your voice. I'm not a native English speaker and your video really helps me speak like a Data engineer. HAHA.
I'm doing my master's degree in Data Science/AI. Personally speaking, my college's courses and many resources like Andrew NG's lecture mainly focusing on mathematical theories. If there are courses about job seeking, it is really useful for me : )
Thank you for your awesome content!"
5858,Don't Buy My Course..,So honest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5859,Don't Buy My Course..,"Hi Ken, I saw your course in it as i had already bought a one year package. as my boot camp starts in a fortnight, i am desperate for time to get my machine leaning code done in kaggle datasets. i will go through your course after the bootcamp. i am currently undergoing kaggle mini-courses to get going. the new visualisation course in 365 also i on-holding it, lol. i watch your titanin walkthrough, several times, its great. but it is too high level for us beginners. i am trying the easier one on estonia. i wonder if you could do something like titanic on a much simplier dataset, for those really beginners out there and me. i like your voice, tone, speed. its really easy to understand. i like 365, its guide learners very well. but then we need more practise on datasets, there is where kaggle comes in. but its overwhelming for beginners too. there are too much to learn to roam around in kaggle, so i took the mini-course to learn how to get its data, and to submit. Thanks for the contents. i watch everyone of it"
5860,Don't Buy My Course..,"Dude I literally binge watched almost all your videos. Thank you so much for providing invaluable and informative information to the general public.

5890,Don't Buy My Course..,Ken is slowly turning into my favourite YouTuber. Thank you so much for your awesome content. Lots of love from 🇳🇬🇳🇬
5891,Don't Buy My Course..,"This man is immensely underrated. You are awesome, Ken."
5892,Don't Buy My Course..,"Hey Ken,
to be honest, I (sort of) knew that you were working with 365,
but I didn't know that you created an entire course for this.
It is very good to see that you really try to create as much value as possible!
I think this course will really benefit a lot of people.


Btw: If a hypothetical person would be in the hypothetical position that they already have their portfolio set up and
basically only want to lern about how to network in this field and get their foot into the door,
especially for more of a machine learning engineering, rather than DS role, do you think this course would be a good fit?
( Maybe I'll buy it anyway tho, just to support you ;) )"
5893,Don't Buy My Course..,Love your channel and your honesty. You're an inspiration. ALLAH BLESS YOU
5894,Don't Buy My Course..,"I plan on buying this just to support you for all the information you've given me, not just related to data science but the way you really break down the ins and outs of the day to day data science processes.  You have impacted so many people and will continue to do so (hopefully) for a long time."
5895,Don't Buy My Course..,"Is it worth it to Learn C as someone who knows R , is familiar with Java and Python. currently I am focusing on Python."
5896,Don't Buy My Course..,I've always appreciated your honesty from day 1 and it's one of the reasons why I love watching your videos! 😄

Good habits, positive mindset, self accountability and focus can lead to great feat in any field."
5900,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"You have worked hard on handwriting.  Another great video , you touched all the important aspects of being successful. Thanks for video."
5901,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"Hi Ken, helpful video as always, thank you! One thing I wanted to touch on was the example around 4:00 about weight loss. Generally, going from fewer skills to more skills is desirable, but going from ""fat"" aka something negative to ""skinny"" aka an admirable goal...just isn't universal, and it can be unhelpful to present it as such. A more constructive way to present this example could be about taking care of one's health, whatever that looks like for different people. It's my impression that Data Science as a field is trying to be more inclusive, and I believe weight inclusivity needs to be part of that. Thanks for reading if you did!"
5902,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"Idk why I missed this video... I'm just trying to sort my activities and learning plan for this month and the 66daysofdata challenge but I didn't knew where to start, this was really helpful because my mind was all over the place haha"
5903,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,Thanks for insights. Lastly my motivation to learn data science dropped. Content like that helps me to motivate myself.

5918,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,You look like shaved Gilfoyle tbh
5919,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"Guys also checkout deepwork by cal newpot
You will be fascinated reading that"
5920,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,I think I'm going to watch this when I wake up every day for a couple weeks
5921,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,Why don't you use ig ken???? I wish I could follow you😣🥺
5922,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,Love you bro. Thanks a lot for these videos!
5923,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,Love the content
5924,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,Ken thanks a lot and wanted to ask you what can I do next after completing python
5925,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,4 disciplines and atomic habits are amazing books!
5926,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"Hey ken,
I resonated very closely with you on the last point of 'focusing on one imp thing' as for a couple of months i was learning data analytics (sql/tableau/excel etc) and ml and dl(Nlp/Cv) all at same time and was going nowhere even after putting atleast 10hrs everyday. This last point made me realize how important it is to focus on one thing at time. Now i'm going to start with data analytics,find a job and build up from there.
Again,thanks Ken"
5927,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"Wow...look at those handwritten checklists / notes...the clocks with different time zones...amazing..
Thanks ken for this video, what worked for me is spirituality (Yes I am an Indian), its just enjoying the present moment, and being in the present, that's it....You can't describe in words what sprirtuality does to you, but its just watching the things happening around you, and not being affected by them ( Karma Yoga as it is written in Bhagwat Geeta)"
5928,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"Hi Ken, nice video. I really liked the last tip, I've been concious that focusing on one thing could bring in way more results than juggling too may at once. However, I have this irrational fear that I'll lose out on time I could be using to do all of those other things, which is why everything is always top of the priority list."
5929,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,The timing couldn't have been any better on this video. Really truly thank you.
5930,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,YouTube=strangers! Haha. Great video never would I expect jump roping in a data science video!
5931,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,There are so many gems in this video! Please make more videos like these ❤️
5932,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"This video was very inspirational in terms of how I can measure my personal success. The pillar of celebrating your successes really spoke to me because I'm in the midst of interviews for internships and after passing some of the initial rounds, I shared my hard work with my supportive friends and this motivated me to study even harder for the final rounds of those interviews. Thanks for the motivational content as always :'))"
5933,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,awesome stuff here Ken
5934,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"Hi Ken.  Thanks for the videos.  I have been watching for a while and just went back to school this fall.   Motivation has been a struggle and this video is right on point for me.   Your pillars help me realign and rethink my approach to school, day job and child also going to school from home!
I have been a data guy for years and figured it is time to “formalize” by background and experience with a degree.  Appreciate your sharing and keep up to solid work!"
5935,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,great content as always ! Thanks man.
5936,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,Great content
5937,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"""Narrowing the scope of things I am trying to learn"" is great advise...another great video !

I learned this the hard way after spending months jumping on to follow every tutorial related to data science I could find on youtube - statistics, data analysis, data visualization, deep learning...etc. It was very overwhelming and didn't do much for my confidence as a beginner.

 I think it was one of Krish Naik's video called ""How To Learn Data Science Smartly?"" that saved me where he explains why we shouldn't try  to learn each aspect of data science separately, but rather find some data science projects and learn different topics with context by reverse engineering."
5938,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"It is awesome and very motivating to see how you evolved so drastically!
Thank you a lot for sharing this;
about three years ago I also was mostly unproductive and did not get a lot of stuff done.
I have been continually trying to make small improvements and I have gotten a long way (but I still have an even longer way to go, of course!)

I really paused for a moment when you talked about the aspect of focus. I have been guilty in the past of trying to do 20 different things at the same time and as a result I have experienced dissatisfaction with the outcomes. I will try to narrow my goals down in the future and only focus on one (or very few) different things at a time.

When you said, that you don't think you have come far, I wanted to add one detail. I don't remember exactly where I have this ""way of thinking"" from, but it was very inspiring to me.
Even if you (as in ""you"" personally) do not feel that you have achieved ""that"" much, it can be motivating to think of people as a network in general. When someone focuses on their own success, they might see that they have done ""average"" or ""somewhat well"", but maybe their actions have affected someone else. And that person affects someone else (else). So while I know the feeling of always trying to achieve more and always wanting to be as successful as possible, I can definitely say that through your channel you have reached a lot of people. And maybe you have influenced 1% or 5% or even more of those people to do something. And maybe those 5% have influenced their own 5% and so on. 
I know for a fact that you have influenced me for the better and motivated me to start actively trying 66daysofdata and becoming more interested in habit building. So I wanted to say thank you, from me, and for everyone else you influenced at least a little bit. You're awesome! :)"
5939,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,one thing i started a few days ago and has helped me a lot is I write down goal for my next day and accomplish atleast one thing early in the morning. this gives me a headstart and once i start the process of completing my goals it becomes significantly easier to fulfill them.
5940,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,Can you Make a Video About writing an article(like medium)? How to Start and How to Write Useful Content with good edit and format.
5941,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"I swear some of the things you said reminded of some of the books you mention:

1. the importance of habits and 2. identity -> Those two go hand in hand together and, one best way to describe oneself is by what we do on a consistant basis. Hence if you can chance your habits, you can chance your identity. 
The growth mindset has been cited in many different book tough I have ""7 habits of highly successful people"". 

Motivation clearly sucks as a base strategy, since it's volatile. Don't get me wrong, it's good to have sometimes, but view it rather as a very good friend who has MANY friends, always willing to help, giving a lot of it when it can ... but who can't really always be there on account of having so many people to help .... Motivation is VERY popular these days if you catch my meaning ;)

Another thing about identity and accounting, and something I've talked about before, is to give yourself proof of what you've accomplished so far and what you are doing right now ... and a bullet journal, for this and feedback (since ppl won't always be there to give it to you) ... this is perfect for this. Make sure to add the proper tracker to it.

And when you feel one of those tracker, that's what Ken Jee here said about about fist pumping and being proud of yourself ... yep, it's very to do that with a tracker and a bullet journal. I can't tell you how many ""YES!!"" I've shouted when marking one ;)

PS:
#66daysofdata
If you watch that video with the intent of applying the advice here to your #66daysofdata ... you might be doing more than 66 of them, and good days they might be just saying ;) (I assume this should count for your challenge in that case). :)
PS2:
Haven't told you that before, but it seems we have something in common! -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnqZl_blT7E :P"
5942,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,i think ken is transitioning into a film maker  more so than a data scientist :)
5943,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,Why those three clocks have three different time showing?
5944,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"Thanks for the video. My energy has been really zapped the last month from depression and sometimes I just need a little re-frame of my mindset. Last night was the first time I opened up some coding learning material. Thanks, Mr. Jee."
5945,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"... My main takeaways were you also enjoy Golden Island Jerky and we're the same age. ;)

Just kidding. Great video and consistent with a lot of things that I've read on self improvement. :D"

5950,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,"This is an awesome motivational video Ken! Thanks for sharing your 5 pillars of success. For me, learning to say ‘no’ can work wonders, to give back time that I could use to be productive and take me a step closer toward reaching life’s goals. As Jim Rohn puts it, “Time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time.”"

5960,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,Very good content i see you from Argentina
5961,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,Beautiful and motivating.
5962,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,Hey could you please get back to me on discord?
5963,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,My only complaint might be that they made it too easy and the value of the cert might not be that high.
5964,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,I think with ML I've had to deal with writing testing protocols for evaluating multiple kinds of protocols. That seems to be something that a lot of online courses miss
5965,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,I agree with everything said in this video! Nice to see new content from you in the new year.
5966,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,Great Video
5967,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"My immediate reaction was ""how do I know 90% of people aren't cheating on this"" and that discouraged me from taking it."
5968,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"One friend who’s a principal ML engineer at Kopernikus automotive told me that the best way to show your skills in ML is to have projects, products or contributing to open source.

No badges or certificates will replace that."
5969,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"I was initially excited by the ML assessment, doubly so when I scored in the top 5%,  but the second that excitement wore off I realized that the assessment was too weak to mean anything. Almost as confirmation of this, a friend of mine who doesn't do Data Science or ML passed it on a whim (he then proceeded to score in the top 5% of 4 or 5 other CS related assessments). Certifications need to be *hard* in order to carry any weight, a lesson many people seem extremely reluctant to learn."
5970,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,LinkedIn clout chaser badges
5971,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the assessment.
5972,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,I give you FIVE STAR for this video . I agree with what you have said. For Corp HR who put such  rocky assessment management to do such idea in the first place. Then the question why we say degree in college or certification in boot camp created by pro in the field and not HR clerks in a corporate. Thanks.
5973,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"Yea. I agree about your thoughts on the credibility of this assessment. But even as a business leader, I cannot imagine this helps either. Business leaders should understand how Machine Learning can affect their products, services, and branding. I cannot imagine that knowing what the nearest point in a K-nearest neighbor algorithm matters at all to them."
5974,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,I like LinkedIn but had no idea they had an ML assessment. Thanks for sharing!
5975,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"True, I have one and you're right."
5976,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"Ken, Thank you for the video. I believe LinkedIn's Job Search algorithm is more optimized if one has the preferred skill badge. It helps the user find relevant companies rather than help companies find skilled applicants. Let me know if you agree. Thank you again for your videos. I really enjoy them."
5977,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"Completely agree, I took this assessment applying for jobs this year, but it doesn't provide any value for people taking it or people hiring!"
5978,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"I did not use Google for the this assessment and got top 15%, which is great IMO.

But I do agree that terminology-based quick test is not really proof of any real-world DS/ML skill."
5979,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,Assessments don't matter if no one else cares
5980,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,WOWZER!
5981,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"From my perspective these assessments are more for candidates than for employers. You can take test and compare your result with others. 
The questions are interesting and not trivial, about algorithms, theory, different methods. Why not. I think that coding skill is secondary."
5982,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"Thanks. Your video will save many people's time. 
I wonder what will happen if your video is shared on LinkedIn lol"
5983,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"So I took this on two accounts (my main account and my burner account). The one on my main account I took without cheating and I was curious to see how I'd do. I took it almost exactly one year ago today (apparently, I took it on 1/5/21) and I passed and it's on my profile because I got in that top 30%. When I got hired and throughout all of my interviews, it literally never came up. Not once. Nobody was like, ""hey, we noticed this on your profile."" They saw my math undergrad degree, my stats grad degree I was finishing, my research, and work experience. 

On my main burner account, I took it to see if it's possible to cheat all the answers and it's super easy. I could give this to my sister who hates anything related to math/stats/programming, and if she googled all the questions she'd pass and get it on her profile. Definitely useless as an assessment. Nice video homie."
5984,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"Hi Ken, have taken the Machine Learning assessment and passed but I never saw true value in the assessment."
5985,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"I've always regarded LinkedIn assessments as ""fluff."""
5986,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"Good points.  I do think maybe this cert could show that a manager knows what various ML terms mean, but that's about it."
5987,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"Ken, hear me out on this one... The people NEED a ""Ken Jee Approved for Data Science Assessment"" on LinkedIn!

Now that's an assessment I (and others... I think...) would take!!!"
5988,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"Hey Ken! Great video! I haven’t taken the ML assessment, but did take Python and SQL quizzes. Passed both, but I believe companies shouldn’t put significant weight on LinkedIn badges. Specifically, Python and SQL assessments tested very specific knowledge that aren’t necessarily useful to me in my projects. My criticism is based on the assumption that these assessments are designed for testing someone if they are qualified to worked at LinkedIn. With that, it is a great idea if LinkedIn can add a feature for one to display their projects. After all, experience comes from practice, no :)"
5989,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"I completely agree. I was nervous to take the ML assessment and assumed that, if anything, my first try would just help prepare me for what specifically to study more before retaking (because with only 15 questions, how would ML ""in general"" be covered?) Needless to say I was shocked at how basic the assessment was (and also how poorly it represented ML concepts). The vast majority of the questions I got addressed the bias-variance tradeoff... and there were a couple of terminology questions if I remember correctly. I don't think you were overly critical at all. I think you gave some great suggestions on alternative approaches that would help tech people better showcase their skills and I'd love to see LinkedIn implement some of your ideas!"
5990,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,I really like this video as I'm a student transitioning to data science from civil engineering and even their assessments on other software are more so to identify where things are (interface-wise) rather than applications. I guess LinkedIn could partner up with software&database companies to create courses/challenges that are part of the application process. I personally enjoyed the MATLAB machine learning on-ramp and would like to hear your thoughts on it!
5991,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"Ultimately the two factors are: the quality of the assessment and how well particular assessments are trusted and utilized by companies. (A third might be whether a particular assessment is relevant to a particular job. Evaluating someone for a starting position versus a senior position are two slightly different things.)

Google's own assessments might be fine for evaluating potential candidates for themselves or possibly other FAANG (. . . . or should that now be MAANG?) company, but is the level of expectations and requirements the same across the board for any company?

Assessments, certifications, diplomas, work experience, etc all have as much or as little weight on a resume as a particular recruiter / hiring manager applies to them."
5992,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"Ken, if you've got to kiss Linkedin's ass on their crappier aspects to be a Top Voice, then we're both screwed... 🤣"
5993,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"LinedIn will never hire anyone based on such assessments. I guarantee if you create a fake name, resume, take the assessment and then apply to LinkedIn for a machine learning engineer position with the company. Report on the outcome, Ken."
5994,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"Happy New Years Ken, first I had not heard of it, maybe I am reading this wrong, I have put considerable time into learning Data Science, which takes years not a few questions. I still  am not where I want to be, but at least I know where I am going.  You want to people to know your stuff then participate in Kaggle. Like you I like LinkedIn, but they really can do better."
5995,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"I think overall, the assessments may not necessarily be a solid indicator because I could just have a second screen to google ASAP. Haha I did that for a few. Also true it would be great if you can endorse AND comment to showcase why or how someone has used a given skill."
5996,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,I haven’t taken any Linkedin assessments exactly because of this reason
5997,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,You are 100% correct Ken. From a this kind of assessment taking there is no value for a data science learner to improve his/her skills and no value for recruiters as well. As a learner I tried that test and only had a small enjoyment for publishing and completing some task related to data science. For true skills development or recruiting processes it doesn't give any value. ♥️
5998,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"Yes, I was initially impacted by these free certification... It's a bad trap in these days... We must instantly get out of it and must empower ourselves with recognising the resources which are really valuable to learn."
5999,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,I don't think I like *any* of the LinkedIn badges... I agree fully
6000,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,Appreciate the honest feedback Ken!
6001,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"You might have lost your chance to be selected as Top LinkedIn Voice for 2021, but you have something infinitesimally better and more important, integrity. 
#theworldneedslesssellouts."
6002,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"I am commenting again because idk where my comment went
so when I first gave the ML test I passed it with flying colors but then my friend told me about this github repo that has all the answers to different linkedin assessments which made me kind of sad because that meant the assessment isn't worth much lol"
6003,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,Thanks. I'm not even going to try LinkedIn learning
6004,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,I agree with you Ken. I haven't heard about it before and surely wasn't expecting this from LinkedIn. They should be checking practical knowledge of people considering the type of platform it is. Really poor from their side.
6005,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,I love LinkedIn also and really enjoyed your constructive feedbacks. I agree that the ML assessment is really superficial and does not critically assess one's ML skill sets.
6006,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"Do employers even care about these ""assessments""? They don't even care about MOOC's which take up a lot more time and effort. A lot of the places I applied to made me do shitty assessments like these. One tested me on super niche Python features like wtf."
6007,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,I did the R assessment a while back. The questions were not very relevant to my experience. It might be better now.
6008,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,Took it and got the badge
6009,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"LinkedIn has been game changer for many people and also me but I agree that linkedin has pros and cons and i think there assesment is not something we should relive on 💯.

And I totally agree with Ken that badges and Certificate won't get you job 🙌"
6010,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,Ken sensei restoring my self-esteem after closing the R assessment halfway Haha .. If it wasn't titled R assessment I wouldn't have known it was for R lol
6011,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,I have taken the python and Machine learning assessment and passed it both. But I don't think it is kind of up to the mark assessment of skills. May be we can named it test flight rather than actual assessment.
6012,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,"It's just not data science assessment, all other assessments are same."
6013,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,Spot on !
6014,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,I took it. I passed it. I passed a bunch of other assessments. The Python one for example and they're all pretty bad.
6015,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,I’ve taken the assessment and got the badge. I think it’a rubbish! I don’t think employers even look at this!
6016,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,Terminology is pretty silly I feel like. Business Value > Everything
6017,We Need to Talk About The LinkedIn Machine Learning Assessment.,LinkedIn is so great at some things and so bad at other things.

6082,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"As a data engineer at the largest shipping company in the world, I can tell you this: a data scientist is nothing without a data engineer and a data engineer is nothing without a software engineer. You need the three of them working together."
6083,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,I'd stick to Data Scientist role coz I love to analyze better but I work closely with my Data Engineers to get the right data source for me to analyze further.
6084,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,Thanks Ken.  As a Data Scientist AND Engineer I agree with your video 100%.  Most of my colleagues and myself wear both hats.
6085,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,Any courses u suggest in data engineering?
6086,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Great content, thanks. i just join a company as a data analyst and going through their general data bootcamp. halfway thru, there is a project and i needed to learn cloud and docker etc. i believe ML-Ops and Dev-Ops are also belonging to data engineering. Could you share more on them? Thanks"
6087,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"What programs would you use to be an engineer? I am currently a data analytics grad student using tableau, python, SQL and R."

6091,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Solid video Ken! 

Should we expect more videos regarding Data Engineering?  👀"
6092,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Solid job, Ken! As a Data Scientist myself, I definitely agree with all the points you have mentioned in this video!"
6093,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Don't know too much about the the market for these roles, but a little bit more tomato sauce on that pizza I had my eyes on from the start, would have been great 👍.
Thanks"
6094,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,Thanks for featuring my article Ken Jee!
6095,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Expectation : SELECT * FROM perfectly_curated_database

Reality : Nobody knows where the data is, locked access, zero documentation, inconsistent metrics, garbage in-garbage out."
6096,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Yes, I would definitely go for a career in Data engineering. You get to see how pipelines are build, you get to understand the flow of data through those pipelines."
6097,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Hey! I'm considering data science as a career, and I was curious on your input as to what the best course of action would be, specifically regarding college. Should I consider majoring in a more general field like computer science, or would it be more beneficial to major in data science?"
6098,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,Why do I suddenly have a craving for burnt pizza?
6099,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,Great! Now I want a pizza 🤧
6100,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Excellent video, cannot agree more. I think experience in a DE role will help you become more effective as a DS later on - you'll gain more knowledge about data infra and tooling that many DS lack."
6101,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,YES most companies think they need data scientists but what they actually need are data engineers. Awesome video!
6102,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"I studied data science to become a data scientist and I ended up becoming a data engineer, but I see a great long term future in it 👍"
6103,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Idk, I'm super optimistic about data science in general. This is one job that has the potential to change the world for the better in ways we've never seen before."
6104,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"I worked in the oil and gas industry and what you said is very true. It is only realized after big AI/ML teams are built that: we don’t really have a big data to work with, or our data are not structured/ready, or our problems are not suitable to be solved by ML."
6105,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Ken, that's a solid point. I agree that companies are finally realizing that they have to hire data engineer before investing in a data scientist. Also, thanks for the shoutout. That was a nice surprise. I appreciate it!"
6106,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,coming for my interest in data science and curiosity about data engineering and recognising that ooni oven from a joshua weissman video in a tech channel makes me realise i watch too much youtube for which i am really proud of myself

6108,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Also Ken, I was wondering your thoughts on algorithm questions for Data Engineers vs. Data Scientists. Maybe a cool idea is to go over different interview questions for the different roles?"
6109,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"I like the analogy that the book Practical MLOps uses. If your home has no access to clean water, then even doing the most basic tasks becomes much more difficult and highly inefficient."
6110,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Why there is irrelevant food prep episodes? 🤣🤣🤣

Ps: actually, video and its point is to the point"
6111,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"When I look at a lot of analysts jobs, there's a huge skills gap in what companies want now. They're either looking for an old school Excel guy w/ 10 years experience or an entry level Hadoop/Spark genius with some Tableau."
6112,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Are you sponsored by that pizza oven company? If not, great. If so, don't you legally have to let people know?"
6113,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,What's with these dumb over exaggerated  expressions in your thumbnails recently?
6114,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"I'd be interested in learning what they do and do some introductory course, but for the most part you've made pursuing Data Science a priority for me."
6115,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,What's with the pizza?
6116,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,Data science will always be more popular than data engineering because “science” is sexy and “engineering” is not.
6117,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Moral of the story: you gotta harvest wheat, mill it and turn it into flour and make dough before and so that you can make pizzas. No wheat, no flour, no dough, no pizza."
6118,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,I dunno if I tried to read too much into it or not but I think each Pizza shot was an analogy lol .. I absolutely love that ! Loved the video and the Pizza making skills 🌻 My long term dream is to open a restaurant after becoming a very successful professional 🍽🍕
6119,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Last year I did a Data Analyst programme and during last winter I started looking for Data Analyst/Data Scientist roles. I ended up getting a Data Engineer role with a local company and for a few months I thought I settled for less. But now, a year into the job, I realise how much better a Data Scientist I can be because of the Data Engineering skills that I have acquired here. 

I was myself blinded by the hype around Data Science, not knowing that without serious Data Engineering skills (to extract, transform/clean, load and most importantly, to understand the journey of) data, all the effort of fine tuning ML models could be nullified by the poor quality of data."
6120,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,so true
6121,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,Just realized why you chose to include baking pizza to compare how HOT Data Engineering is.
6122,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,dbt ftw
6123,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,if i become data scientisit i become hot like you
6124,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,Hi Ken are you saying you recommend Data engineering than data science ?
6125,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,I was just enjoying the domain pun and then I heard a shoutout for my channel! Thank you so much for linking me! And great video as always.
6126,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"2:26 TFW Ken Jee calls out the type of company you work for that has failed to invest in data engineering 😔😰😭... thanks ken....thanks

Based on the pains I've seen, I'm SUPER optimistic about Data Engineering and think it's going to go ""TO THE MOON"" these next few years!!"
6127,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Based on my experience on the job market, Data Engineering is competitive right now, but it's easier to find a place that is willing to train you on it compared to Data Science. I was an analyst for almost 3 years doing a lot of programming and just got a job as a Data Engineer. I was upfront about my relative lack of experience but showed them all the ways I have worked on bridging that gap, and they are willing to train me. I don't think I could find a company willing to do the same for Data Scientist, those usually ask for Masters or PhD at this point."
6128,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"I told a girl I was a Data Scientist, the 'Sexiest Job in America', and she didn't give me her number. 

Did I do something wrong? Should I change careers?"
6129,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,seriously stop with the clickbaity titles and awkward face thumbnails dude. unsubbed.
6130,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Nice pizza b-roll, yummy 🍕. I also think that existing data scientists will significantly benefit from a little data engineering skills, perhaps the field may eventually move towards becoming a full stack data scientist?"
6131,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Hi Ken, Thank you for making great content on Data science and engineering in general. Do you have recommendation for Stocks or Options related Data science material?"
6132,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,Any good data engineering resources you can recommend?
6133,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,What is the future of data engineering?
6134,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,This video is just making hungry 😅watching that pizza 🍕
6135,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"If we think of Data Science as a field of study rather than a role, then Data Engineers are technically data scientists."
6136,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,The pizza b-roll is too funny for no reason
6137,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,Those pizza making b-roll cracked me tf up xD
6138,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Hey Ken Jee, thanks for the great insights! Right now I'm working on a project that involves integrating data from multiple sources for other people to use, which is very similar to data engineering,  but my goal is to be on the data analysis side and I'm hoping that in the future projects around that will arise. With that being said do you thing that doing this kind of work will pay off in the future, or should I be doing data analysis and data science instead? P.S. I have less than 6 months experience in the field so far.
Thanks!"
6139,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"I’m fairly new to data engineering, but I’m beginning to notice that there are some segments in Data Engineering approaches to solutions - custom code, implementation of tools, and a hybrid approach each with their own pros and cons.  Custom code can be a good solution when there isn’t an out-of-the-box solution, the job is small, but this can take time.  Prebuilt tools can get problems solved quickly, but may lack some functionality/features and can be expensive.  The hybrid approach seems to be the most useful, but it takes a lot of knowledge to know how, where, and when to make these decisions for a business solution."
6140,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"A career as a data engineer likely appeals to people, like myself, who enjoy building stuff that endures over time."
6141,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"This video definitely triggered my jealousy by looking at your pizza making flex 🤡🤡

Well as they say, many people just go on for the sophisticated stuff without even clearing the base. I think same is the scenario with data. Many companies joined the data science hype but didn't pay attention to their data or it's architecture. So now as a damage control move, they're back to sorting out their basics and now we need data engineers.

I was waiting for this topic to be touched and finally you did!! 🤠🤠🐢🐢🐢"
6142,Why Is Data Engineering So HOT Right Now?,"Would you consider a career in data engineering? Let me know in the comments below! Thanks for watching everyone!

For anyone wondering... Yes, I did make this entire video just so I could use the zoolander clip at the beginning."
6143,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Wow this is so interesting! How crazy the consequences of unsupervised machine learning that went wrong. Great video, Ken! Very well done! I really enjoyed this kind of analysis of real life problems we're facing."
6144,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Can we say it as a biggest machine learning model failure ? Idea is definitely good. I also think that whenever a big company buy something people expect good amount which may sometimes overestimated... Also fixing old house is more trouble than building new one...
6145,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Lol. Flop hahahaha!
6146,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,i like your take Ken; you should definitely check out vin vashista's thoughts on this if you havent already. he wrote a really fleshed out piece that i found very insightful from both a machine learning and stakeholder perspective.
6147,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Machine learning is not even machine LEARNING
6148,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"By building an instant offer system, they provided a great incentive for people who knew that their properties were not worth the offer to exploit the system. If they didn't give themselves an out via a contingency on appraisal, then they were just plain stupid. An appraisal costs a couple of hundred dollars. If they were losing 80K per flip, then they earned every penny of loss that they took."
6149,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,More of these kind of contents please!
6150,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Just a case of using ML for the wrong reasons to reach the wrong goals. How do you take this big of a risk when the entire country is basically in an economic bubble? smh CEO was over his head.
6151,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,More of these types of videos por favor
6152,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Finally, rich person/company gets screwed by (data) spreadsheet. Couldn't have happen to nicer bunch of idiots."
6153,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"The machine learning model did not fail. The business model failed. Zillow had an excellent understanding of the market. After a year of doing this, they had more experience than the average house flipper in buying and selling houses. 

Their problem was that they were in a market for lemons. The people most likely to sell to them were also likely to be the worst value. They did not properly mitigate that risk, so they ended up losing a lot of money."
6154,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Scenario 1: Zillow's offer is 10% BELOW true market value.
Scenario 2: Zillow's offer is 10% ABOVE true market value.

90% of people in scenario 1 are going to reject Zillow's offer, while 90% of people in Scenario 2 will accept. The problem doesn't lie in the ML model, the problem lies in the strategy. The further out of Zillows favor the estimate is, the more likely the seller is to accept and vice versa.  I'd wager that if they monitored flips from sellers that rejected their offer,  they would have profited (had their offer been accepted)."
6155,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"There wasn't a real state expert to evaluate the model?

And I do like this type of content, can you make a video about containers prices, and it's reasons?"
6156,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Carmax transformed car buying and selling with their automated models for evaluation. But houses aren't as homogenous as cars even 2 houses identical on paper and less than 50 feet away from each other can have $100,000 differences in price."
6157,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Isn't it also the case that if they get it wrong to the seller's benefit, the transaction will happen, but not the other way around?"
6158,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"This is CRAZY!!! When I sold my house earlier this year, all the home buying estimates (Zillow, Opendoor, ect) were all SOOOO low. But like you said, better to underestimate than overestimate."
6159,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Hi
6160,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"My first rule of ML Engineering is that you need to spend a lot of time on two sides of Feature Engineering: The input side that creates your state, and the output side that needs to accept it to create that future state. If they would have spend more time in estimating not just the prior stage in the value chain but also the next stage, they might not have ended up in this situation. I.e. if they would have spend as much time to understand the behavior of real estate agents for example, they could have discovered that there are many cases in which they should have created a portal in which only professional real estate agents have access to that database first and can take that estimate as a suggestion and continue the process; revealing how the discrepancies come to be. This way you could get expert input from crucial parts of the value chain in front of you, ride the value chain instead of trying to compete with it. In empirical science people often underestimate the impact of qualitative data compared to quantitative data. And that is exactly what happened here.  My 2ct."
6161,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Great storytelling and expert analysis.  Would definitely enjoy seeing these data story type videos more
6162,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Great analysis, thank you. Do more case studies!"
6163,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,What came to mind was an asymmetric information model from game theory. Perhaps the seller knows more than the buyer about it's flipping potential?
6164,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,I work in real estate and was wondering why Zillow wasn’t auditing their deals. Valuing properties that need renovations is tough to automate.
6165,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,It's like blaming your calculator
6166,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Here's a different idea. Maybe they sold off because they were leveraged up too much on the wrong kind of debt. If they predicted the market was going to tank next quarter in their AI models, they might have made a rough but necessary trade-off. Losing $500M instead of losing $10B."
6167,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Extortion/property taxes and public pensions will be in the toilet and those are excellent things!
6168,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,This is such an excellent analysis. I checked a few entries in some neighborhoods I know and they were often way above the market value.
6169,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Hi Ken - can you clarify why you said that an optimal algorithm should always underestimate the price? Shouldn’t the residuals of your model be normally distributed - i.e., 50-50 underestimate-overestimate? I’m struggling to figure out how a model could always underestimate prices, since that would mean always negative residuals."
6170,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Great job, Ken. I think mistakes we're made, also one other thing to consider. There was a social media campaign against Zillow's flipping business on Tik Tok and Twitter. Do you think this could have contributed to a change in consumer behavior?"
6171,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Thanks for teaching us that machine learning is evil and should never be used : )
6172,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Never heard of zillow before but this was insightful ❤
6173,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Thanks for an explanation from a data science perspective
6174,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Ken, hear me out.... instead of going into the Papaya business, let's go into the housing industry ...looks like there is an opening... I think we could build a helluva algorithm 😜"
6175,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Really interesting video !
6176,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Great work. I would to watch more such videos.  Could you talk about Spotify recommendation system and it’s success?
6177,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"title should've been ""How Zillow Lost $500 ZILLION with Machine Learning Zestimate""
great video though honestly, thanks ken"
6178,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Hope Richard Barton might be looking at this video during weekend, realising his mistake blaming on ML models"
6179,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Isn't the biggest issue that the transaction dynamic here is set up in a way to maximize the impact of any mistakes in the buyers favor and minimize the impacts of mistakes in Zillows favor?  In other words, even if the Zestimate was 99% accurate in its offer prices, the incentive for a buyer to accept an ""accurate"" offer is much less than their incentive to accept an overpriced offer, so the impact of the 1% inaccuracy is destined to be magnified."
6180,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,The problem was too much trust in evil machines
6181,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Did you know about the Family Guy clip before you put it in or did you find it while making this video? Either way, perfect!"
6182,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"This also shows that something is wrong with this company’s culture. People directly involved in the housing transactions, if they have some general sense of the local housing market, should know that the price is wrong and be concerned, but there does not seem to be a channel for that concern to be seriously heard by the upper management."
6183,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,great video once again Ken
6184,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,I love this style of video
6185,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Thank you for this great video. This should be a case study to understand what machine learning does and what type of risky models need to be run with human intervention.  👍
6186,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Great video, Ken! As someone in the business, how did Zillow's mistake affect companies look to data science?"
6187,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Very informative Ken,  and a great video. Thank you"
6188,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,That a great case study regarding the concept of Antifragility!
6189,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Awesome content Ken! Inspiring for data content creators man, great editing."
6190,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Great job, Ken. I would love more of these kinds of videos where you analyze real life applications of Machine learning models and the results from them"
6191,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Very informative video Ken ! Would definitely watch it again and take notes .. I appreciate the amount of work and research you have put into making it 🌻🌻
6192,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"We sold our house to Zillow right before they stopped purchasing homes a few months ago. When they made their offer I knew something was very wrong, but I wasn't about to tell them that :)"
6193,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,This doesn't surprise me. Real estate investing in my opinion is an art. It takes a vision that can't be broken down into an algorithm.
6194,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Thank you for video! It's really useful. Using ML algorithms has a lot of underwater stones.
6195,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Hey Ken, thanks for touching on some issues which were glaring a problem.

But just to emphasis, flipping a property  to a potential buyer at a current market rate may not have been a ""good"" choice, as
current market value does not include in the renewal cost the company incurred for the house.

You also did mention the model should adjust with a volatile market - VERY TRUE !

but this does not mean Zillow should have sold properties at a lower price, when the market is down to show that real-estate business is still thriving. This could have created a property-bubble.
So their idea just backfired thinking that selling properties could spark more buying ...this market is dynamic on the back of demand and NOT supply.

""Hey the pictures look good of the houses on sale, but I would still go there and see the property myself. ""

As you said in the section ""What is the zestimate really ?""  they should have had professional opinion to get a good grip of what the house-price should be. I think the business model was to eliminate such an intermediary, so that the ""negotiation"" is downed.

Thank you for this video Ken, because I'm an aspiring ML engineer and trying to become a Data Scientist; however I want to use these skills into actual business and this video has given me an insight...

How to succeed in a business using ML/DL as tools that compliments my other skills.  Maybe become a real-estate developer who has Data Science and ML skills and not just a General ML or DS pro.

Cheers"
6196,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"Hey Ken, I love this kind of video, very rarely you see ML applications in industry and their results so you can learn from it."
6197,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,Very interesting video. Lots of takeaways here!
6198,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"It’s amazing how you’ve found all relevant B-roll videos and cartoons that matches the content. Flip flop, great joke :)"
6199,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,This is a very interesting subject to cover! Can you make more videos on ML in business and what made the models successful or unsuccessful?
6200,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,If I have $500M to lose I would be so happy
6201,How Zillow Lost $500 MILLION With Machine Learning,"What do you think, will Zillow be able to turn it around? Let me know in the comment section below! Thanks for watching everyone!"
6202,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"The simplest solution is doing the work. If you can make something work, then you are that smart. If not , you aren't.  Beyond that ,its difficult to deal with, as it becomes a sort of gray area.
Feynman put it best. "" I'm smart enough to know how dumb I am"""
6203,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),Much more important topic to talk about. You wrap it elegantly.
6204,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),The first second of this video describes my life lol
6205,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"I am yet to break in this filed, but I totally get you. I really like to learn new things and this field is full of surprises. I love it."
6206,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),I feel quite insecure when trying out a new project from Kaggle and feel that I am just copying others and not doing anything unique. What would you suggest as a method by which I can overcome this insecurity and push myself forward?
6207,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Thanks for sharing Ken. This is very familiar feeling. That is why I have guilt feeling that i havent spent enough time working even though I've been coding and learning 10-12 hours daily.
Keep up sharing great content 👌"
6208,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"I never have any problem with this feeling as long as i am working like crazy and learning new stuff but if i take a break for 2 days or sometimes even few hours, it kicks in and motivates me to work even harder. I like it. Doesn't let me get comfortable with what i know."
6209,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Yeah I kinda didn’t deal with my imposter syndrome in the healthiest way,... I tried to just learn absolutely everything before applying for internships as an undergrad. I would just sit and cram and learn stuff thay most interns as an undergrad wouldn’t need to know going in."
6210,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Got this video on feed and it was a divine timing . 
Ps: we have same glasses 😂💯✌️"
6211,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),Thanks for this video. Being rejected during many past interviews led to me having similar feelings of imposter syndrome despite past success.
6212,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),I am an SAP Business warehouse developer that uses the SAPs proprietary language ABAP but exposure to coding limited to work exposure. SAP's stock tanked 30% since it missed the cloud bus and it has kind of given me a pinch of diversification. Does it make sense to invest in learning Datascience and switch gears?
6213,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),I think it's time for you to create patreon and youtube subscriptions!
6214,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Which data structures would you recommend knowing the ins and outs of for a data science interview as opposed to a software engineering interview? So far I’ve been focusing on arrays and recursion, and eventually want to get into graph algorithms."

6216,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"I work as a data scientist already, I wanted to know how to get clients on my own to work on data science products, I feel that a lot of middle management don't convey the right idea about data science hence I want to see if I could start my own consultancy on getting projects, I wanted to know how is it possible?"
6217,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Loosing, Failures, Doubt just have fun enjoy them... 
It's not atom bomb 💣"
6218,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Thanks for bringing awareness to this. You've been such an awesome mentor and educator!!!! We all have those moments, imposter syndrome sucks :/ Keep making awesome videos!!"
6219,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Ken, I wouldn't sweat it. I don't see it as you giving me advice (which if I were in your position, I would feel it overwhelming and with a lot of responsibility). The way I see it, it is that by you sharing your life experiences and other people experiences, when you do the interviews, your are providing me with invaluable information. I think, it is MY responsibility to take the information that you provide as an advice or just as interesting information.
I appreciate all the effort that you put into researching the topic and putting it in an understandable manner. 
By the way, I got the point of your video, that is embraced it and grow with it. 
Thanks for your channel!"

6221,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),I have never seen so long meaningful comments in any YouTube video ever. Seriously Ken Jee you are showing the power of truth and doubt (❔ )
6222,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Great video as usual, smashed it and its not only applicable for data science, I think alot of what you said applies in life. If the smartest man in the world Socrates said ""I know that I know nothing"" what makes anyone think they know everything."
6223,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"You are the lamb bearer in a really Dark tunnel. 

It is upto people to follow your advice or not. 

People like me who follow your advice really admire you."
6224,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),bro i wanna give you a hug
6225,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),This was a cool video!  Thanks
6226,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Man mad respect for opening up on this subject.

Cheers from Bolivia"
6227,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Very power message, thanks!"
6228,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),I needed that! Thanks for sharing and appreciate all that you do for us!
6229,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),I wanted to ask you what framework or editor will be the best to learn Python. I want to start learning this language but I wasn't sure how to do so. I saw some videos using Sublime Text and Django but as a beginner I will like to have this big-small advise.
6230,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"""We fail more then we success""  - so Data Science is like real Science... In Academia you only have high success to failure rate at low levels. Once you get to new and complex things it can get hard. Really hard. And depressing. Of course you can always be that lucky one and get your experiment parameters right in first go. ;) 

I used to be what a lot of people would think of as a ""real scientist"" (the one that does experiments in a lab coat, in a lab to discover and create new things). A lot of things in Academia is presented as if the success was effortless, nobody is showing the amount of work that went into it, results from failed experiments rarely get published if at all.

One of my friends also has imposter syndrome (I have different issues ;) I am always hungry for knowledge and new things and I love solving problems; also I'm unemployed atm so I can't have an imposter syndrome)...

As for failures - this is a normal part of the process. I don't remember who said it, but it went like this: when you enter the a new uncharted territory, when you try new things nobody did before, everybody is underqualified for the job. I think this is a huge part of what being a Scientist is - you try to do new things, and you fail, and you learn from it and you try again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Some problems can't get solved at this stage - maybe new tools, theories, new data need to appear first. Sometimes it is too expensive to do what is needed to get a good solution, maybe an approximation can be good enough? I'd like to say that this is why you get paid the big bucks - because it requires certain way of thinking, intelligence and skills to solve problems. To be a Scientist it ain't an easy job in general. Sadly a lot of Scientists are really poorly payed. And a lot of research is conducted in a very bad, unproductive way, but that's an off-topic.

The job hunt - IMO it is a bit of lottery. And just because someone has amazing credentials doesn't necessarily mean they are amazing themselves. I've worked with people that had PhDs from an university ranked in world's top 25, one of these people came even from a VERY VERY good research group... and they were not living up to the standard I imagined. The best Scientists I worked with came from UK (university outside the country's top 10) and India. Of course good credentials do help you to get a job. That's why you should get them. But also get the understanding of the things you are doing and the knowledge of the subject. A PhD diploma is a proof a person wrote and defended a PhD, it does not make someone a good Scientist. Maybe it should, but these are two different things.

I also heard words of wisdom that went like these: don't compare yourself to other people, you don't know their full story. Compare the you of yesterday to the you of today.

I'm off with that - this comment is getting too long. Good video Ken :)"
6231,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),Thank you so much for this video! It resonated so much with me. I usually get these waves of insecurity aka imposter syndrome although it's always lurking in shadows. I have learned to just  keep going and try to be honest about what I know and do not know. I have been told that I should be more confident though 😬
6232,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),Ken been acting kind of sus.  I think he vented! haha great video as always!
6233,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"I am just a beginner in this field, still trying to adapt data science and ML and whenever I see my friends around me who are also doing the same thing but almost most of them had already started 6 months prior to  me and they're doing so good. I doubt that if I will ever be able to learn all these concepts. :|"
6234,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),I'm always doubting of my skills lol
6235,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Thank you Ken, this type of videos - honest talk - really helps! Bests."
6236,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),letterly this is what I feel almost in every competitive environment I engage in. Some times I have objective evidence that I am worse than most people  like in sport when no one picks me to play in their team. And sometimes in the contrary I think I'm bad but when I see other people's performance I know that I'm not. I think that is because we fail to something called survivorship bias. Most of the people that we see are successful since successful people have more popularity so the sample of people that we are comparing ourselves with is not random.
6237,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Me: ""Wow I am seriously unqualified for this position......

better apply!"" 🤡
Okay but in all seriousness, thank you for your honesty on this one. I think you spoke to what a lot of us are feeling & it's great to know none of us are ever alone on this :)
also.......can we or can we not get a #66DaysofData Among Us game night one of these days?!"
6238,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"As a beginner, I've had this feeling for the past 6 months, when I look at job offers there is always one or two or plenty of things that I'm not familliar with at all .. but you have made it easier for me to improve myself each day through your videos and tutorials, and hopefully I will land an internship in the next 2 months."
6239,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"After 2-3 years experience, I have a strategy for dealing with imposter syndrome. Keep a reading/to-learn list, with techniques, frameworks or anything data science related. As soon as you feel a spell of imposter syndrome coming, learn something asap and don't stop learning until you feel better again"
6240,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"One thing I neglected to mention is that part of impostor syndrome is that you feel like you're going to get ""found out"". Luckily people usually a lot more wrapped up in their own insecurities than they are in exposing yours! Thanks for watching everyone!

6241,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Thanks for opening up , actually after seeing this video i felt so much better it's like you express the doubts inside my head all this time , and honestly, i believe you are doing a good job, at least there are a lot of things i ve learned through your videos"
6242,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Great video and topic Ken! I think everyone feels this to an extent. Super important to be humble and modest, although confidence is key too!"
6243,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"I really liked how he talked about learning to like this feeling. I think a physical training metaphor here is really apt. When you work out it hurts and is uncomfortable as you train muscles you may not be using very often. One thing many people who work out regularly talk about is how good they feel afterwards, even though their body is in pain. Similarly whenever you learn something it hurts, almost phyically. You can feel your mind straining to try and understand whatever abstract concept your reading about. For some reason we are surpised by this. ""Shouldn't this be easier?"", ""How does anyone understand this"", or ""The guy in the video I watch made it seem like this was easy to understand"". of course we do not see how long they had to sturggle to actually understand the concept. If we go in with the expectiation, this going to hurt but I love that feeling of brain ache after a good reading I think it can help with those feelings a lot. The other issue is time, the feeling that you need to become competent in a short ammount of time sucks. I don't know what to do about that, we are finite creatures after all."
6244,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"I feel like in the technology field Impostor Syndrome has just become a consistent feeling a lot of people develop..I remember doing my Bachelor's for CS and constantly feeling inadequate or inferior by comparison to my peers cause I felt like my coding abilities in comparison to theirs were terrible..That got heightened when it came to applying for jobs and getting rejections all throughout college...Ironically the one thing that kind of got me out of my own head when it came to that feeling was Data Science..I found a genuine passion for wanting to do it and that kind of helped me subvert the Imposter Syndrome I felt from coding at least...Now I'm in my first semester of going after my Data Science Masters and I still feel that Impostor Syndrome looking at how qualified my peers are by comparison and questioning my own abilities yet again but also having gone through it the first time around I realize a lot of that is just me being in my own head....similar to how you've embraced it over the years...Thanks for posting about this Ken...You, DataLeap and the Data Professor have become my go to channels to watch ever since I started my Data Science journey 2 months ago and hearing that you feel that level of doubt in your own life even with how much of a great figure you are in the Data Science community is honestly kind of relieving to know......"
6245,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),This approach to the imposter syndrome is really needed and might be a truly helpful for many. Thank you for this Ken Jee
6246,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"I’m new to the field. I feel like I know absolutely nothing, but I’m going into a master of Data Science because I truly want to do AI/ML work. I don’t have a traditional CS background, so this is all scary. When did everyone get comfortable with the AI/ML coding interview and overall interview process?"
6247,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),I'm glad that you don't use background music anymore 🙏
6248,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Hey Ken, I think this video is important because for the last decade or more, life has been shown through rose tinted glasses and instagram filters. Being real with people is exactly what (I) people need I think, especially in this bogus job market. Thanks. Have a good weekend."
6249,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"while imposter syndrome is self-focused, it is inherently comparative -- trust yourself and what YOU bring to the table :) everyone is on a journey here, and NO ONE knows it all"
6250,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),"Honestly, I started being more organized in the field of Data Science when I started following your contents and your supports. I still remember myself few months back when I don't know how to write a good resume and how to organize my GitHub projects and LinkedIn profile. Without your regular updates and supports I would never be here, no doubt. Personally, I am so thankful for your support and you have done great things for us, Ken."

6260,The Only Data Science Explanation You Need,"Hi Ken, as always, your videos are insightful and easy to follow. Would you say that  one of the main distinctions between a data analyst and a data scientist is that the analyst focuses on what happened? While the scientist is looking for future possible outcomes? Thanks so much again for your hard work in helping us!"
6261,The Only Data Science Explanation You Need,Great! Now I can just shove this video in my parents' face next time they ask me what I plan on doing later on in life LMAO
6262,The Only Data Science Explanation You Need,"Wow, this video is brilliant. My only problem is that the title looks like a clickbait when it actually delivers what it promises haha.
So much chatter around data science these days but very few voices really know the field and of those even fewer have the clarity and generosity to share it in approachable/useful videos like this. Congratulations for the quality of your work and a big thank you."
6263,The Only Data Science Explanation You Need,"I noticed in this video you mention the tools used for a Data Scientist but don't say too much about the math that's used regularly. This seems to be a common trend on ""How to Become a Data Scientist"" videos. They almost exclusively talk about learning Python, R, SQL etc. but rarely go into any detail on the math involved in the field. I'm in a masters program for Data Science and it's pretty heavily math focused to begin. Just an idea for a future video. 

Anyway, thanks for consistently putting content out, you're videos have really helped me in understanding the direction I want to go!"

6308,The Only Data Science Explanation You Need,"Great video, Ken! 
One of the first examples of Data Science(though it was not called Data Science then) comes from John Snow’s famous map of the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. Before germ theory was known, it was thought that Cholera was simply in the environment and that it spread at random. John Snow conducted interviews, mapped data points and graphed the results, leading to a single water pump being identified as the culprit. This was founding moment in Epidemiology and Public Health.

Just sharing my learnings as well. Cheers :D"

6432,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),please provide the link of dataset you are using
6433,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Thank you for these
6434,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Hey Ken, thank you for creating awesome playlists. I have never come across a video with a detailed explanation of how to approach data science problems. And your videos are such a lifesaver!!!"
6435,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),20:06: Dat stats PUN! hahahahaha XD
6436,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"man...you are a legend..I wanna get into data science..I had loved this field since i was literally 8 years old, I always loved to keep stock of all my stuff, toys, books etc, i started with maintaining a work book on my notebook, even though i barely knew how to write lol, and then i started using MS Access, Loved it so much as a kid, it was mostly DBA than data science though, until I started watching a lot of football, tennis etc, try and analyse the data from each match and started to build etc etc yk how it goes and today about a decade later, I am super interested in the field.. I know basic Python, R, Power BI, MS Analysis services, etc etc, But i wanna know a how to get self taught a good path to follow, hope anyone could point me in the right direction, thank you.."
6437,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),9:28 why do we have to use dict.fromkeys() ?
6438,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Yeah plotly is pretty nifty, but I have a hard time understanding the logic of how to do things past the more basic plots because the documentation can be a little lacking when trying to customize something. I did some poker analysis using plotly and can understand the struggle."
6439,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Thanks for sharing this, Ken. Looks amazing and that's what I need. When I try to follow ur way to code, I found an easier way to do that in 14:22, which is in ""In [12]"" (the heatmap part). Actually we can order the data by ""df.sort_values(by=['Q1', 'Q6'])"" before we plot the heatmap."
6440,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),This was really helpful. Followed the tutorial to the end and would say plotly is a very nice tool for interactive graphs and plots. Thanks a lot for making this available.
6441,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Excellent work Ken! I've never used plotly before, those charts look really great!"
6442,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Plotly is not showing up in Jupyter lab. Had to do the following:
!pip install plotly==4.14.3
!conda install jupyterlab 'ipywidgets>=7.5' -y
!JupyterLab renderer support
!conda install -c conda-forge nodejs -y
!jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly@4.14.3"
6443,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"This is awesome! I have barely started this journey, but your videos make me confident that I can actually learn and do this :)"
6444,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Some high-quality content. loved it.
6445,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Hi im curious about the code list(dict.fromkeys([i.split('_')[0] for i in df_fin.columns])). Why does for question 7 for example has only one in the list where it has like 12 parts. If you split it should not it be Q7, Q7, Q7, Q7....repeated 12 times. Is it because in dictionary you cannot have duplicated keys?"
6446,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),You are really making a difference by showing the steps and hands on methodology of the work that a dat scientist does!  Thank you!
6447,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Great video. I am new Python so its great to see some uses for dictionaries and some of your clever aggregation techniques. I completely relate to the Plotly struggle as I decided R Shiny, rather than Tableau or Power BI, was the the tool for my Masters project in Data Vis. I spent days and days working out the kinks in all my visuals but it came in really useful when I did my dissertation and had to visualise my results. Plotly is painful but powerful."
6448,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),This is amazing and I thing I am learning a lot with this series and hope make my own end to end project one day💯 just waiting for damn ideas to come to my mind😂

I am really grateful that I can sometimes ask some doubt to you here... Do you have any telegram group or anything where we can put our queries or discuss about our projects?"
6450,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Such a great head start for people who are new to Kaggle!! (or even for people who are new to data science for that matter)   Great work Ken!
6451,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),I NEEDED THISSS!!!
6452,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Ken - Really enjoyed this video.  I think it is incredibly valuable to see your approach to learning a new Python package - especially to those new to the field that are struggling with imposter syndrome.  Googling and seeing how other people have tackled a problem/project you are working on (and even using some of their code) is perfectly fine and in lots of cases probably the most efficient way of learning a new data analysis method/skill/etc.

I can't wait for the logical next iteration of this style of video - livestreaming your work!"
6453,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Thank you for the training. Am learning how to approach a data set from a data science view. Am two months into learning data science Msc.
6454,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Ken , what do you think about Tensorflow?
I use a macbook and have been stuck with issues (modulenotfound and PIL errors) since a week. I've literally followed every single stackoverflow and github issue thread but nothing seems to work. Does tf, in general, doesnt work on MacOS?

This is my error(if anyone's wondering):

!python {'/content/generate_tfrecord.py'} -x {'/content/Training'} -l {'/content/label_map.pbtxt'} -o {ANNOTATION_PATH + '/train.record'}
!python {'/content/generate_tfrecord.py'} -x{'/content/Testing'} -l {'/content/label_map.pbtxt'} -o {ANNOTATION_PATH + '/test.record'}
running which gives me the error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""/content/generate_tfrecord.py"", line 29, in <module>
    from object_detection.utils import dataset_util, label_map_util
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'object_detection'

6455,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Maybe you could review some good kernels from beginner to expert level as a finishing video for this series?

Btw here's my novice approach: https://www.kaggle.com/sniggdhaa/why-consider-being-a-db-administrator-engineer 😁"
6456,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Its amazing bro... Its very cool🤗👏👏
6457,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Legend goes that the model is still training
6458,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Awesome stuff! Thanks a ton 😁
Very helpful to understand how to approach"
6459,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),I have a python question: why does the line at 8:55 'qnums = list(dict.fromkeys([.....]))' work?  Shouldn't 'dict.fromkeys' only work for tuples not lists?
6460,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),So for the first 6 questions (not including the country question) I converted the data types to Categorical and set the order I wanted them within that step. It made it so that the plots I made were in in that order without any additional code in the plotting step. Do you think that would cause any issues down the road with other parts of the process?
6461,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Thank you very much. Very creative graphs. The most interesting was how you used dictionary for multiple answer questions👍👍👍
6462,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"This is really so cool! You have to really collab with Bad Friends. Their pranks hella are like Vitaly mixed with MrBeast! They're an insane group in Cali.

You should totally check out their page out and give the friend group a subscribe! 👉 #SanitizedBadFriends"
6463,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Hey Ken.

I currently have 60-90 credits from a bachelor's of arts in business from a state University. I haven't completed a degree and currently have 5 years of experience working IT on government contracts.

Is it recommended that I finish my degree in something on the business side such as finance, learn SQL/python/stats and try to land a BI role?

Or should I go ahead and pursue a science degree such as a bachelor's of science in CS? 

Goal is BI/DA --> MLE/DS one day"
6464,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),This is so much valuable for a “student”. Thanks a lot for sharing your progress and process!!
6465,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),This was so informative please do more of these series!!
6466,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),I prefer tableau for this kind of advanced analysis...but still I learned a lot thanks alot ken jee..
6467,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),put this in today to do list :)
6468,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Great job explaining your thought process Ken!  I really like that you work to be as efficient as possible!  Looking forward to the next one!
6469,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"A like and a comment even before watching the video because whenever I see ""From Scratch"" in the title of any of your videos, then I know that there is a high quality content waiting for me!"

6477,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Great visualisation Ken 💯📊
6478,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Awesome! That advanced graph is so cool. Should I start learning plotly and stop using matplotlib and seaborn?
6479,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),yey! I was waiting for this!!! Great stuff Ken! I wish I had your hability to document things step by step
6480,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),Thanks
6481,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),It was nice to see the process of visualizing the data. I'm sure I'll come back to this video if I'm dealing with a similar dataset
6482,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Looks amazing, Ken. The advanced graph looks great. I will go through the link and work on the Notebook as soon as possible. Will be learning a lot about EDA from here. Thanks for sharing!!"
6483,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Finally!😅 waiting for this for a long time ❤️
KEN JEE You will not believe that I am addicted to your channel 😂😂"
6484,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 2 (Exploratory Data Analysis),"Here early today, will be watching this later tonight. Awesome, the epic T-shirt is out 😆"
6485,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),Why did he / you ignore r studio column in df_model ?
6486,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Hi Ken,

Great videos as always. I followed this one until 12:07. I am seeing 1.000 for R-squared and 0 for all P-values. Back in part 2, when doing the scraper I had to cut the numbers down to 250 because the process kept disconnecting. During data cleaning that number was cut down to 38. Although the numbers were vastly different compared to yours, I was able to work with it because it still produced all of the insightful analysis. Now I'm unsure if I should continue because both R-squared and P-values look weird"
6487,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Hi Ken, i love the way you are making the videos for the entire DS process. I would like to add a point for this video where I suggest if you have spent the feature selection process Or criterias to add more values to model and this video. Just my 2 cents for the video. It's good work done. Keep going. All the best"
6488,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),Jesus
6489,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Hi Ken ! i'm facing issue while importing  'import statsmodels.api as sm' , i have installed statsmodels already ,  the error is : 'ImportError: cannot import name 'datetools'.' please help"
6490,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),Whoa!!
6491,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),You can just do:    max(error)  to get the max value in error list
6492,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"For finding the best value for alpha, instead of making a data frame,
We can also do,

alpha[np.argmax(error)]

np.argmax(error) returns the index of the error and we can use it to get the alpha value.

Hope this helps."
6493,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),Thanks for putting this all together. More explanations on the algorithms and metrics would have been even more helpful.
6494,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),What is the reason you are picking the alpha with max(error) should we not be minimizing this?
6495,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"This is a great overview of the modeling part of a data science project. It has inspired me a lot, thank you so much for this kind of content, Ken"
6496,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),This is an amazing series 💯
6497,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"I am trying to build a multivariate linear regression model, and trying out different combinations of variables to build my model. For example, I build a model with interactions between  different variables, but another model with just main effects. My question is, when do we know that we have a solid model that is worth accessing for need of transformation? I am a little confused on what steps I should be taking to build a meaningful model."
6498,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"hey ken , wonderful video i was wondering where did u get the eda_data.csv file because in the past video we didnt save any csv file???"
6499,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"One of the best series I've ever seen on youtube related to data science. Thank you so much for this amazing effort. Very inspiring and motivating. Highly appreciated, bro."
6500,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),@Ken Jee We can't use Ridge regression in these kind of data because of sparse nature of dataset. Right?
6501,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Hello Ken, I have a question probably is a stupid one but I need an answer. How and in which step we got eda_data.csv file. I watched the videos but maybe I missed it. Thank you so much for your help."
6502,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"good vid , im not sure but you insert alpa = .13 when in the lasso regression , not sure if its an mistake."
6503,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Hey Ken, newbie here but loving the series and would love to see more. Wondering what 'level' of data science this is. Is this quite similar to what a data scientist would actually be doing in a work environment?"
6504,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),i'm getting a straight horizontal line when i plot Lasso regression. any idea why that's happening?
6505,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"for my case, the MAE  was 
Linear Regression MAE : 5.6690763194922056e-15
Random forest MAE: 0.015459375000001213

is it correct?"
6506,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),I did this on my own data and the r-squared is 0.15 and average of the mean absolute error is -592780108. Anyone got super off results like this?
6507,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),Bro can u make more series like this? This inspires a lot
6508,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"I’m working with a dataset containing around 100,000 rows and my grid search has been running for around 3 hours now (using the same parameters as you). Is this normal? Could Jupyter notebooks potentially be the problem?"
6509,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Hi Ken, thank you for the fantastic video! I am having an issue with my linear regression, I was getting an error that my X_sm was an object so i converted it to a float, but my R-squared value is 1.0 which just doesn't seem to be correct. Any ideas? Thanks again!"
6510,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Hey Ken!! Fantastic series.When you instantiated GridSearchCV as gs..and passed rf,parameters and scoring in it..it also requires verbose parameter..mine is not executing without verbose..(ps: am using jupyter notebook)"
6511,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Really appreciate your work, Ken"
6512,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),#This Lasso instance is not fitted yet. Call 'fit' with appropriate arguments before using this estimator. how to fix this error can't find anything in StackOverflow!
6513,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),Hey Ken how would I use a combination of 2 models?
6514,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Hi Ken, at 12:00, when checking the multiple linear regression summary, for variables that has either very small coef (slope is close to zero) or p values smaller than 0.05 (statistically not significant), can we `safely` remove them from the regression model?"
6515,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Another question is that, in my data, the multiple linear regression performs fairly well with the training data (use cross validation) but really bad on test data, is that caused by over-fitting? 
For Lasso and Random Forest, it's fine"
6516,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Hi Ken, thank you for the tutorial, I have followed along from the beginning until here, I must admit that the most fun and useful part is to watching you got stuck by something and went through debugging. 

I have a question for dealing with missing data, in this example you consider ""-1"" for most categorical variables as a ""new"" category (by using dummies that's what it is in my understanding),  wouldn't it better to replace them with other forms or try to predict them using available values? It'd be great if you can share some insights on that. Thanks so much, please keep it up."
6517,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Another super helpful video. Thanks Ken!

Do you mind sharing a link to your Kaggle profile? I'd love to explore some more of your work."
6518,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),Quick question: Would feature normalization and normalization of skewed data improve the results in this example or is it unnecessary? Any quick comment would help thanks.
6519,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"At 11:58 when you wrote this code
X_sm = X = sm.add_constant(X)
model = sm.OLS(y,X_sm)
model.fit().summary()

After Writing this code i am getting this error
ValueError: Pandas data cast to numpy dtype of object. Check input data with np.asarray(data).

I have searched on StackOverflow , applied different solutions but none of them worked"
6520,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"If you also get an error message  (ValueError: DataFrame constructor not properly called!) when making the function to get the best alpha for the Lasso model :
err = list(zip(alpha,error))
instead of
err = tuple(zip(alpha,error))
Good Luck !"
6521,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Hi Ken Jee, I have a question. So i m following your series (which is just so helpfull), and i tried to make some kind of a different approach without getting too far. I m making the same project, but instead of predicting the salary, i m predicting the ""skills"" required . Its about values from 0 to 3 : no degree/years of experience : 0, Bachelor : 1, Master : 2 and PhD : 3. Everything seem to work well until now. I made the linear regression model using sklearn and the result of the cross validation is extremely high beside the result i should have ([0:3]). So i tried to fluctuate the CV parameter, but it didn't change much. Do you have an idea of what could be wrong ? Thank you so much for your work !"
6522,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),Hi Ken. I have a request from you. Increase size of codes script for who watching you on mobile please. I know you sometimes zooming but thats not efficent.
6523,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),Great series sir..! But I just wanted to ask what is the difference between using stats model & LinrearRegression() as I was usually using LinrearRegression() to train model so not getting the difference
6524,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"This really is great stuff Ken!  Out of curiosity,  Why don't you have a patreon page or something?  You content is so valuable to aspiring data scientists, I'm sure people would want to support you."
6525,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"I was also wondering, for the regression, since you use dummies, shouldn't you throw the base level of the categorical variables to solve any multicollinearity issues?"
6526,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Hi Ken, very informative series. I would love other series like this dealing with other data science techniques such as deep learning, reinforcement learning or other machine learning techniques."
6527,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Thanks for shared your knowledge. 
One question. in before video ""part 4"" the file ""eda_data.csv"" did no exist. in this video you work with that file, where does it come from?. Thanks."
6528,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),You make it look easy.. I am a beginner.
6529,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),Your explanation is so Clear and easy to understand i learned so much from you ken
6530,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Great video Ken! 
One question: in the train test, it is common in the industry to train at .8 and test at .2? or does it depend on a factor that I don't know about, a brief answer will be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
6531,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Hey Ken I have a question, so I’ve been following your project step-by-step to see if I can do it myself and follow along. Thanks for that, it’s great. Anyways, I can’t help but keep doubting myself and thinking I’m not good enough, like when I get I stick I see what you would do or go to stack and see some answer I could’ve never thought of then I wonder how I’m ever going to make it in this field and be successful and then I get demotivated and stop studying, do you have any tips? Maybe something you went through that’s similar? Thank you."
6532,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"I think one of the most important lessons of the video is: documentation is your best friend! Don't fear it, befriend it. Great video as always, Ken!"
6533,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"Hi Everyone - Thanks for watching! I have gotten awesome feedback thus far on this series. Again, my focus here is to show that data science is an iterative process. You will constantly find bugs, errors, and make mistakes. You will also have to work through them and seek to understand them. I would love to hear about some of the problems errors or bugs you faced that you ended up figuring out in the comments section!"
6534,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),Really love your approach man.
6535,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),"So amazing to begin watching you before you began these series and then having this amazing 5 part lesson. There is no better teaching than practice, and you really just show practice. Excellent!"
6536,Data Science Project from Scratch  - Part 5 (Model Building),1st viewer i was waiting for it
6537,Where to Start Learning Data Science,The best thing I learn from personal experience is that the journey of learning data science become much more easy if you follow less number of data established data scientist as an online mentor. The less the better. I personally follow this channel and it helps me Alot in my journey.
6538,Where to Start Learning Data Science,I'm hooked to your channel. Your content is relevant and has offered me insights and motivation on this journey that I started one year ago. Thank you very much for sharing your time and knowledge...
6539,Where to Start Learning Data Science,All the things you said really helped me in my journey of DS.
6540,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Go for it guys..!
6541,Where to Start Learning Data Science,How do you maintain notes during learning or building projects of data science? I think video or audio recording works better for me....
6542,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Thank you for your videos, Ken! I don't have any math background besides Stats 101. What level of stats would be helpful to get started in data science?"
6543,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"I greatly appreciate your channel.  I am always trying to figure out if it's best to concentrate on learning how to use one tool like Pyramid and be proficient, especially when you don't quite have the time to learn to code as well.  What's your take?"
6544,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Free courses of data Science please...
6545,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"ken Jee sir ,,,what are the things should i learn to become a data scientist ..."
6546,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Hi Ken, I am an Entrepreneur in manufacturing and holds a masters degree in manufacturing as well. Due to pandemic I had to close my business and am looking for opportunities in data science. I have completed few courses including the zero to mastery course by Daniel bourke which helped me create a lot of interest in this field. I am hoping to relate data science with manufacturing. Can you advise me about the same. Is it possible to find a job in data science as I am from a different educational background?"
6547,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Hi Ken. Based on your experience do you think/consider as possible to start a carrer in data science at 28 age?  I studied industrial engineer and I am interested on it but i ask it because of the needed time, average, to become a good data scientist.  Greetings"
6548,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Youtube suggested your channel and I had to watch. It was last week. Then I returned in order to find a video on ""Where"" to start learning. But, what you talked about was ""How to learn"". I mean, the advices were ""No matter what courses you watch, just make sure to do in a way that you feel that works for you. Look into Kaggle and learn from built projects"" and such. However what I couldn't find is exactly where to start on languages. 

Please, please, don't get me wrong I'm just trying to understand where to focus the inicial focus to learn this science.


What I was looking for was something more fundamental, like ""Start learning Progamming Logics, then you should tackle the basics of a programming language like R or Python, then you should learn about DB with...""
I don't even know if it is necessary to learn about database to be on Data Science lol.

Again, don't get me wrong. In reality I'm asking you: What are the fundamentals to start to learn this awesome job?
I see the enthusiasm about this topic on your videos and for a long time I had this will to learn, however I'm not a programmer myself, in any language at all. Could you please, help me to find the initial step?

Thank you for your videos, they made me like Data Science even more, even when I don't understand almost nothing about this world.

Wish you success and waiting to see more videos. If not about my request, well, Data Science is already enough for me to follow the channel."
6549,Where to Start Learning Data Science,So happy to have found this channel. It's like I found a mentor. Thanks for the videos! ❤️
6550,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Great channel! Linked & Subscribed! 

Do you have books recommendations for the ML concepts? Most books I found explain how to code but I'm more interested in the math & stats behind those concepts.  Thank you"
6551,Where to Start Learning Data Science,you are the best
6552,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Given that I do not work full time current, do you think it would be feasible for me to spend 6-5 hours a day (in 1.5-2hr blocks) learning various Data Science building blocks / projects. I did spend most of my time studying/sitting in lectures back in university, however, not having done that recently may feel a little overwhelming if I do decide to spend that much time on learning again. P.S. I am enrolled in Springboard Data Science Career Track."
6553,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Hey Ken,

I'm gearing up to apply for an online master's in DS.  I have a bachelor's in math and an MS in stats from a decade ago that I ended up not really using (long story).  I've started learning python and I'm not completely sucking at it so I feel like I'm on the right track but my math skills are obviously pretty rusty.  Any idea what kind of math I should brush up on to prepare? 

 The program itself hasn't even started, UT Austin is still putting it together and planning on accepting applications in the next few months.  I was hoping to just get a little ahead of the curve."
6554,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Videos improving every time man ♥️
6555,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Thank you so much for this video!
6556,Where to Start Learning Data Science,First time I see someone from youtube use Spyder :D
6557,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Solid content!!
6558,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Hey ken great video as always. I feel like on of the things people miss is consistency, if you do just a little but every day you will get there eventually. That’s actually stuff I talk about on my channel I am Vloging my path from no code to data scientist in 6 months. See ya!"
6559,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Can anyone pls suggest some good laptops budget of around 50 k for learning & practising Data science....? I need your help i don't have any laptop before so pls help me I want to learn Data science ......! I'm waiting for ur reply... Thanks in advance ..!!
6560,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Hello Ken, thank you for sharing your insights. I was curious if you have any videos where you go over soft skills / how to tell a compelling story?"
6561,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Thnx Ken ! You are my fav YouTuber as a beginner now!
6562,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Great video! Thank you for the advice!
6563,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Ken Jee :)
I am doing ML right now.
I realized I am not good at Data Structure and Algorithms. I find people advising to learn them.
What should I do?  I have a problem with doing one thing at a time. Please mention importance if any.
Thank you :D"
6564,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Hai ken thank you for sharing with us the way we should take to learn becoming a data scientist. Honestly, many people still have lack of listening in english, including me. Would u like to add caption in this video? Thank you"
6565,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"hi, thanx for all the videos they r really a great content.
am asking if u can have a video about remote working and internship, because am from morocco and i love data science and am starting learning it but companies in this field here is so rare so am asking if there's a chance to get a remote internship in american companies after i finish my studies and projects ?"
6566,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"I saw ads, I clicked.
Tks for your very useful sharing videos.  Send my best wishes to you!"
6567,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Brilliant work as always. Is it true that there are no datascience jobs and internships for freshers that are recently graduated from college or do they need some work experience in order to get a job. Does being a SWE in a big tech company adds as a advantage to get a job or do we have to have datascience domain experience only to get a job in FANG companies. Do reply.
6568,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Thanks ken, great video. 

I am on the project level:
I am doing Twitter sentiment analysis and learning NLP.

I have a question, i refer to other people's github for guidance... Like the github i am refering for twitter sentiment analysis uses NLTK but in my project i am using spaCy.. 
Can i show this project in my resume?"
6569,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Thanks for this Ken. Im learnning Data Science by my own and im trying to find the best type of learning that is best for me, your video helps me a lot, ill try to do more projects and see more the documentation"
6570,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Really like the advice you give us here, especially the kaggle part! I have been using those trick of reading someone kernel/notebook but it does get overwhelming, so knowing that it's hard for everyone really put me at ease. By the way, would you mind if I email you just to get a piece of advice from you regarding my study path?"
6571,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"What a Irony sir I always gets the solution of my problems every time from your videos at perfect time.
👍👍👍♥️"
6572,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Hey man, really enjoyed your video :).Would like to ask a few things. I've started a data science course on udemy and I would like to know if there's any platform that you know of that would help me practise the concepts I've learned. Let's say I just finished regression, and I want to practice some problems on regression, where should I go.

Also, would it be possible for you to make a Kaggle tutorial that would help us familiarise ourselves with the website? Like I tried to get on Kaggle and found myself lost and everything looked very high profile and I didn't know where to start as a beginner"
6573,Where to Start Learning Data Science,What do you mean by documentation? You were abit vague there. Could you elebarote on that? THANKS
6574,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Hi Ken.... Please do live project or end to end project like you did with data scientist salary prediction
6575,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"жаль я ничего не понимаю в английском и что ты говоришь, но ты крутой !"
6576,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Hi Ken! I have a doubt regarding the projects. It's like what stream should I pick up, should I experiment it first, what suits me where  I should be moving, or else is there any particular domain to start with,  for career options."
6577,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"The videos you prepare are so on point and informative. It is not vague. The  correct amount of informative touch with a pinch of reality. Hope it gets more amd more better from here. The only video that didnot satisfy me was with jay, it may be the rich content he has in his youtube channel already, you just stopped the questions with few..anyway enjoying the growth..thanks."
6578,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Love the B-Roll scenes!  
Huge fan of doing projects to learn. Applying the concepts I learned into projects has helped things stick better for me!"
6579,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"I found your channel just after I started learning Data Science about a couple of months ago, and you've been really helpful and encouraging man."
6580,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Keep growing the channel, Ken. 100k is just around the corner!

And I wholeheartedly agree with your tip of reviewing other people's code. My number one tip is to go through GitHub and search by keyword for projects that interest you. From there, you can find people's scripts and run them chunk by chunk. This way you're learning from people that have a good coding foundation. This is one of the methods I used to learn R."
6581,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Hi Ken! I’m a 15 year old in highschool and I just finished a course on Data a science on Udemy. I have attempted a few projects on Kaggle and they’ve worked out pretty well. Do you have any advice on how I can progress further and some goals I can work towards?
6582,Where to Start Learning Data Science,"Thanks for another great video, Ken! The video editing and transitions are awesome! I certainly agree that one of the misconception of learning data science is limiting one's learning to a particular resource, as you said, nothing is stopping us from learning from another resource. Because the thing is, different resources may bring slightly different angle or coverage of the same topics and thus helps us to gain a more thorough breadth and depth of those topics. Really like the ""rinse and repeat"" part, learning data science is indeed a never-ending iteration loop."
6583,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Informative tips! Cannot stress the importance of learning how to read documents!
6584,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Thanks a lot Ken! Awesome content as always...
6585,Where to Start Learning Data Science,That was awesome sir i really loved that and pretty much motivated by that. One unique thing i noticed today was your camera quality(that was awesome)
6586,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Hi! I am from India. Here the IIT (India's one of the best technical institution) is going to provide a bachelor degree course of data science. It's a 3 year online course with exams to be attended being present physically in their campuses. So should I just concentrate on that course or complete it side by side along with Computer Engineering?
6587,Where to Start Learning Data Science,just loved the image/audio quality on this one! congrats Ken!
6588,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Is that the 1080p 34 inch monitor? have the pixels been enough for  you?
6589,Where to Start Learning Data Science,Awsome video ken sir..

6605,10000 Subscriber and 100th Video Special (Data Science),"Congratulations! There is not many informative channels out there and I'd say I'm lucky to find yours, given that YouTube algorithm is not too friendly to smaller YouTubers.
Video Idea: How do you analyze your own Youtube channel data?"
6606,10000 Subscriber and 100th Video Special (Data Science),"Sir i have couple of problems unrelated to this Video, I am a 3rd year engineering student from India, and planning to go ms in data science in USA after 4th year. 
1.is ms in data science really worth it from current and future of industry persepectie, like I am seeing that some people prefer 2 years of industrial experience over 2 years of masters but I really like ml and want to publish papers in this domain. 
2.Now i have read couple of books on ml and DL but now i am confused whether (a) . to start learning practical application of ML(like I have build a model but what next..... To make my model more interactive and useful, like I don't want to show companies my (.py file), so to solve that problem maybe I should go for MLops(devops + ml) or
(2) .read more research papers, learn new and advance algo and techniques which no books or course teaches u, start doing competition and maybe go for writing a research paper which would be very helpful for my  ms admission in good college.
Can u help, like any advice would help a lot on what should my direction of working after gaining so much knowledge but have very little practical knowledge of impelnting.
Thanx and sorry for such long question"

6660,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Great Playlist, loved it! One feedback would be to focus the screen share on the coding part of Spyder, it is tough to follow because the code is just a small part of the screen."
6661,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Hey! I'm learning data science from 3 months and I have completed probability, some part of stats and python, now I'm learning Linear regression and clustering. I have not yet started with the deep learning concepts. But I want to start my project now and build the project along side the theory do u think that is a good idea? Also at this level is it good to start with this series or will I be confused as I don't know many concepts? Also I am self learner so if you would reply it would be of a great help😁"
6662,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Great video ! I just binge watched the whole playlist 😍
Just a quick stream question: how do you deal with a super wide monitor and  sharing your screen at normal aspect ratio with OBS ?"
6663,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"It was a journey. I am about to finish my project and I can't thank you enough.  Hadn't I followed this playlist, my final project would be simply a bunch of code that no one would understand.
Thanks again Ken."
6664,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Thank you so much Ken. When someone loves the subject and teaches it to others, they will also start loving the subject. With your detailed unedited video, I gained a lot of confidence. I used to get overwhelmed with so many terms but seeing you I understood that not everyone knows everything. You just have to start with an idea and learn along the way by getting your hands dirty. Thank you once again. Have a great day!"
6665,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Thank u so much for this series, it really gives me a lot of insights^^"

6669,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),Bloody well done mate!!
6670,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Watched this full series. It's a great one. One thing I found when you were correcting hourly to annual wage ,you need to calculate Average salary again . As after doing hourly to annual wage min and max salary got changed.
Thanks"
6671,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Thanks for the series Ken I really appreciate it! Small detail though, but it looks like the y-axis on the histogram in your EDA is labeled ""job_state"" when it should be something like ""num_job_postings""."
6672,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),Hi Ken wanted to ask if its possible to make an API endpoint that takes in multiple rows or a file and outputs predictions for each row in that file at once
6673,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"HI, Ken Please make more videos on end to end project like this starting from data collection to documentation"
6674,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Thank you ken, i never thought i would come this far in data science and you made it much easier to understand."
6675,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Hi Ken, really appreciate the time and effort covering the technical aspects of data science as opposed to just a generic theoretical road map suggested by many. Helps to put things into perspective for those keen in this field. Great work btw!"
6676,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Thank you so much ken for Markdown cheatsheet and for providing all the valuable information through this project whole series finally completed the whole series still facing few problems, error but I will try to solve it...keep making videos like this...best wishes for your channel...Thank you once again!!!!"
6677,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),Learned a lot from this series Ken. Thank you soo much and hope you will add more projects like this in the future. Can you take up a really messy dataset and guide us on the cleaning part as a video?
6678,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),YouTuber of the YEAR!!!!
6679,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),This is amazing series thanks it helped me a lot ...

6681,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Thanks, this series was really useful to see what goes into a good project from beginning to end! I loved the honesty and openness (including how you showed the debugging process and where you copied code from online whenever you got stuck on something)"
6682,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Dude, this whole series is awesome. Thank you thank you thank you."
6683,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),Great and informative series! Keep it up
6684,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Great Series Ken! Very informative and easy to comprehend from a novices perspective. One question I do have and forgive me if I am not understanding this project correctly but how do we use this tool practically? We are able to scrap the listings from glass door and ultimately make a model to estimate an avg salary for a job but when it is all finished is this a tool where we can plug in a job title and a set of skills or something and it returns an average estimated salary for said job (for maybe salary negotiations of a current position etc.)? Sorry if this went over my head when going over the project!

Keep up the good work and I will continue to follow along!
Sean"

6697,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),keep doing great work man
6698,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 7 (Documenting Your Work),"Hi Everyone! Thank you for watching this series. It has gotten far better feedback than I could have imagined and I am grateful for everyone who has watched it. Again, I hope that it was helpful to you! Let me know below if you would like to see more videos like this, and what if anything you would change about this series. Thanks!"
6699,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hey Ken, 
Thanks for the useful video, I am very interested in learning data science,  but I am not sure if I can pursue it because I have got like 0 knowledge about it , could you help? 
Love from India"
6700,Is Data Science Right For You?,I don't know whether data science is for me or as non tech person but I want to spend some time to explore to let it know.
6701,Is Data Science Right For You?,Few days back started exploring data science and today YouTube randomly suggested me your video. Already loving this channel.
6702,Is Data Science Right For You?,I believe data science is for a person who has life long learning attitude. As Data science is fast evolving field and it requires you to have daily learning attitude.
6703,Is Data Science Right For You?,Watching two years old video of yours got me noticed one thing that you improved amazingly in both video quality and the way you explain stuff.
6704,Is Data Science Right For You?,Waaaay better than how my college has explained so many computer science fields!! THANK YOU!!!
6705,Is Data Science Right For You?,"i kinda find it cool, but too intense.
I did a bachelors in law, then did a bachelors in business informatics. 
I did so much better in my informatics degree but the it was the most taxing and I would shut down and literally quit school a couple of days after projects and exams. I was quite a slow learner, despite my 3.7 gpa.
Im just looking for a career that pays a lot where the skills required are not so broad.
I feel like accounting could have done the trick.
Im about to do an internship as a data analyst, im honestly still not sure about this path and I dont know many ppl as clueless as I am about their interests, after investing so much time in education. Any advice?"
6706,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hi Ken,
I am an Computer Engineer and have a bachelor's degree on the same field. Furthermore, I am thinking of pursuing my further Studies in Data Science and I am currently working as a .NET developer(love to code). I found Math, Probability & Statistics interesting during my semesters over the years. So I think it would be good for me to practice with Data Science right? I'd like some of your feedbacks & btw awesome video :)"
6707,Is Data Science Right For You?,sexy field accompanied by sexy hardwerk and sexy youtubers
6708,Is Data Science Right For You?,Hey I got a question would you say that data analytics and data science are similar or way to opposite ?
6709,Is Data Science Right For You?,"#36: I am involved in CS long ago, and this new path of Data Science is really interesting.
The hardest question for me has become the opportunity to actually, get the job or the internship not being a recent graduate. Let's see if I can solve that question! 
By the way, as always, great video! #66daysofdata"
6710,Is Data Science Right For You?,In short : Don't get afraid and embrace the storm.
6711,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hi Ken, I am regularly watching your channel now and thanks for lots of great videos. I have recently declared double major on DS. And, my  current fear is that I have encountered lots of data scientists saying that ds requires solid understanding in math. I have already took Calc 1 and 2. However, it was a while ago, so i believe i need to restudy them. And, I still need to take a stats course and linear algebra. So, im currently wondering how strong of math do I need to know if I want to go into the field? Or, how in depth do i need to know of math? For ex, would I need just basic understanding of calculus, stats and linear algebra. Or, do I need to know them solidly by knowing good enough to take “honors” or “higher” courses in that I can implement them however I want and solve bunch of Olympiad level questions? 

Also, would it be okay for me to learn math through online courses or books to acquire skills, or do I need to take courses from a college in order to show that I have taken courses? 


Thank you as always and rly hope that you can give me some insights on these."
6712,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hi Ken,am from India,  I have completed my engineering from electronics branch.but now am doing 6 month course on data science.how long will it  take  for a person to land as a data scientist"
6713,Is Data Science Right For You?,You have a good series of videos here... The best part is you are properly guiding us whether one should go ahead with it or not. This is self analysis which is very important and this is what I leaned through this video...
6714,Is Data Science Right For You?,"My biggest hurtle seems to be the degree.  TL;DR - Due to the Department of Veteran Affairs, I effectively can no longer get a Bachelor’s in the U.S. (without first having tens of thousands, and at that point I could transfer my first 109 credits), so I’ve been learning a lot of the math on the side.  Programming I’ve been doing since I was a child, but I’ve still a lot to learn to become a data scientist in other aspects.  Anyone who may know, I’m intrigued, in your experience, approximately what percentage of data scientists do you know who hold no degree?  I imagine not a lot.  But then again, I’d finish my degree if I could, too.  🤷🏻‍♂️"
6715,Is Data Science Right For You?,The audio is a bit soft. Max vol on ipad still soft
6716,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hello sir, 
I am doing Master in Computational and Data Science. I am currently learning some subjects like scientific computing, parallel computing, algorithm engineering, mathematics models for optimization problems. I want to know how important are these subjects in Data Science and Machine Learning because i want to deep into DS and Ml."
6717,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hey , man great insight,  I'm a brand new student and 2 years away from getting my batchelor in data science  at city tech my only fear is that I won't get a job because my school is not prestigious. Is this a real issue?"
6718,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hey ken, been following you for a while, been studying data science online and wanted to get a complete textbook with all the info, anything you can suggest?"
6719,Is Data Science Right For You?,"I have a major in electronics , so maths required for data science is not an issue for me . Can you guide me about other skills I should learn and how to get DS job as fresher"
6720,Is Data Science Right For You?,How much time it takes to become an industry ready data scientist?
6721,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hello sir I am Akash from india currently doing my graduation in science. Once I get to know about field of data science, after that I am just researching about this field. Now I made my mind to draw my career in data science.
So please assist me.regarding me about the scope of this field. How can I be successful in this field?"
6722,Is Data Science Right For You?,Bro I have a doubt. I am interested in CV and NLP but not interested in linear regression kinda stuff. Can I learn CV and NLP from the beginning itself?
6723,Is Data Science Right For You?,This is incredible. Thanks
6724,Is Data Science Right For You?,Hi Ken. Is data engineering realted to data science? Can u suggest learning path for it please?
6725,Is Data Science Right For You?,What is the difference between Data Analytics and Data Science?
6726,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Thanks so much more for the video.. Actually I have interest in Data Science and i have just gotten admission for my Msc in Data Analytics but i do not have any basic knowledge in Machine language, programming and all the necessary things needed to make the course easier for me, and i am really interested in this course, please, what do i do to meet up with the standard of the course and also to finally achieve my purpose in choosing this course?"
6727,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hi Ken,
I was wondering the level of math you need for DS, I’m getting mixed results in my research. I was a biology major in undergrad and the highest math I ever had to take was calculus I (basically just doing derivatives), and this was a long time ago so I don’t remember how to do it anymore. I was exploring data science masters back in my school and others, and they’re open to non STEM majors, and the most math they require was statistics.
  Do you need to know differential equations, linear algebra, and more advanced calculus? Or statistics and the various statistical tests covered in statistics will be fine?"
6728,Is Data Science Right For You?,You are the hottest data scientist!
6729,Is Data Science Right For You?,Sir your glasses looks good
6730,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hi Ken, Firstly thx for video. I am a psychology student from turkey and I intersted this field (DS). We study on SPSS program and study some statistics topics on our department. Can you what recommend for me to me for go my DS way.
My backrond is enough for this field? if your answer no; what I have to do? I wanna growe up myself for Ds by self learning. Now, I am study Python and then I will learning R, ML and AI."
6731,Is Data Science Right For You?,New here
6732,Is Data Science Right For You?,Thank you Mr.Ken jee
6733,Is Data Science Right For You?,Wow
6734,Is Data Science Right For You?,He is so hot and that's why he's on daily creater 🤤
6735,Is Data Science Right For You?,Hi
6736,Is Data Science Right For You?,Very nice Aman
6737,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hi ,  i have a masters degree in Marketing(major) and i had 1 year experience in sales.I wanted to switch my carrier to Data science. will the degree&experience help me in my carrier transition to Data science??"
6738,Is Data Science Right For You?,Sir. .any mast degree is required for data scientist ..?
6739,Is Data Science Right For You?,"For none CS majors, what are the top cs topics that once need to master to be successful in data science ? What are some good resources?"
6740,Is Data Science Right For You?,I found you from another YT channel you just commented on today. I am thinking about taking a certification course in Data Science from eCornell. What is the best program in NYC would you suggest?
6741,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Sir, This is prajwal & graduated with   bachelors in mechanical engineering in the year 2018, who has 1 year  of  work experience in procurement & Business Development & I have got a offer for M.tech in Data Science & Engineering.


Is it advisable to accept this offer as I have don't have any knowledge on any programming languages with a basic knowledge on coding in C programming. 
  

Kindly guide me in accepting this offer or to reject this as i suppose I may find it difficult during the tenure of this course.


Waiting for your reply."
6742,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Sir, can you say the books that you liked most to be a data scientist please make a video on that"
6743,Is Data Science Right For You?,Nice piece of advice Ken. Good job 👍👏
6744,Is Data Science Right For You?,"How do you develop your skills in calculus? I never took calculus in high school, and I'm barely in my first year of college."
6745,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hey Ken, I've got a Data Science Internship interview this week and am very excited (and nervous as hell) to get my foot in the door. Thanks so much for these videos, they're honestly gold!"
6746,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Yes, data science is right for me in probably more ways than the number of roommates I've had the last 7 years, which is too many! lol  However, like you said in one of your comments below, getting into the field ASAP through being a data analyst would probably be a better bet for someone in my situation who is severely underemployed, has loads of debt, and wants to have a better quality of life. In all honesty, I would be quite content with a data analyst role. I would see it as a stepping stone and an opportunity to improve in all areas in life. I see becoming a data scientist with an emphasis on big data engineering or machine learning engineering as long term goals and becoming a data analyst as more of a short term goal (18-24 months), with luck and or strategic networking maybe 12-15 months."
6747,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Your advice is spot on:
 1. be prepared to put a lot of time and effort into learning (in truth, the learning never stops. 😁)
 2. be proactive about finding problems and solving them (plus, keep in mind there's a difference between asking for help because you're truly stuck vs. asking for help because you're too lazy to figure out how to solve a problem. Data scientists are supposed to be really good at problem solving. Being a data scientist who's asking for help all the time kind of undermines the purpose of being a data scientist. 😉
 3. learn the math (I actually believe that most people have the ability to understand the math but, most have been taught math in a way that's not relevant enough nor interesting enough to them. When done right, I can't see how anyone can not love math.)
4. learn coding
5. tell great stories


Also, a quote I heard recently, makes a nice addition: ""For some, data science is an opportunity. For me, data science is a passion."" 😊 When you go into the field for the right reasons, you'll do whatever it takes to get great at it.


I enjoyed watching this video. Keep up the great work."
6748,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hey Ken,  
I've opted for Data Science as my majors in my university, but I've a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. Can you explain how data science can help me work in AI and ML?"
6749,Is Data Science Right For You?,Good to see you
6750,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Good content!!
Keep it up🤓,"
6751,Is Data Science Right For You?,"Hey Ken,  I have a few data science projects(python/sql) that i'm working on while taking edx classes but also work full-time as mech engineer trying to switch careers. The emphasis on masters seems to be quite apparent among DS jobs especially in Cali. 


If I want to go through masters in cs, i would have to be part-time(financial reasons) but also put all my projects on hold due to time constraint. It would take roughly 1 year for me to get around solid 4-5 projects to complete but 2.5 years for my masters.


What are your thoughts about this? going the personal project route or masters route? I wish I can do both but that is a recipe for a burnout. I enjoy the technicality of DS and want to get into the industry asap.

great vid btw!"
6752,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"I have been reading a lot about investments and budgeting for the past couple years. A book that really made an impact on me is ""The Millionaire Next Door"" by Thomas Stanley. One of the most important concepts that stuck with me is understanding and balancing your offense and defense with money. ""Offense"" means controlling how much money you make - which you often have less control over. And ""defense"", which is how you spend money which is more controllable. It is pretty data heavy...which you might like as a data scientist."
6753,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,Watching this in preparation for actually reading a book next year. Great video Ken!
6754,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Bro I can definitely recommend Leo and Longevity to you, he has a lot of videos about topics that surround health such as genetics, sleep, food, and especially longevity. Could be extra interesting to you as he studied statistics at the LSE"
6755,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Hey Ken, thanks for the video!

One of the nonfiction books that has impacted me the most is ""Factfulness"" by Hans Rosling. It shows inherent biases in how we perceive that data is generated and get a misrepresentation of the world. Really worth it!"
6756,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"This year is good for me in a sense that I already read more than 15 books.
I was expecting ""Atomic habits"" to be on number 1,it is such an amazing book that can brings Alot of changes in anyone's life."
6757,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Ken is going to write book that would be a one page book. And Ken be like ""Papaya is the best food and best diet is to follow Papaya diet""., 😂😂😂😂"
6758,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Atomic Habits: Just start with one push up a day...

David Goggins: Excuse me???"
6759,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Hi Ken. Read ""How not to die"". That will really make an impact."

6761,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,Thanks bro
6762,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,Loved this video. Atomic Habits is my all time fav.Waiting for more book recomendations.
6763,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Hey Ken,
read ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" if you haven't yet. It's about how we constantly make bad/wrong decisions without noticing it, and what psychological mechanisms are behind it. These mechanisms are so fundamental to our thinking that even if you are aware of them, you still are prone to making those thinking errors. It's basically more than half a century of Kahnemann's own research distilled into one concise and very densely written book and probably the best book of the 21st century to date."
6764,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Hey Ken... Great recommendations... These are covering almost every part of our life... I would like to recommend Rich dad Poor dad, I'm currently reading it now... It will help us to understand importance of financial literacy..."
6765,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,thanks for the recommendations... one thing i need to implement among the many  is cutting out social media time
6766,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,7:35 to 8:09 this is such a good point everyone ignores the sleep like no 6 hours of sleep is enough for me no it's not same for everyone you don't need pills to be healthy you just need good and long sleep.
6767,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Have you read How Not to Die? That's the book that has had the most profound impact on my life.

You talked about how our gut microbiomes affects the way that we respond to individual foods, but you didn't mention the way that what we eat impacts our gut microbiome. Eating meat adversely affects our gut microbiome, and even our gene expression. While there is plenty of room for individualizing dietary patterns to get people to eat food that they are more compatible with, the broad dietary patterns are clear. Eat minimally processed vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and minimize or eliminate your consumption of animal products, refined sugar, refined fat (oil), and processed foods. While the answer of a plant based diet is incomplete, it is at least moving in the right direction, as compared to keto and carnivore diets, which are both associated with increased all cause mortality and environmental destruction. It wouldn't surprise me that meat is worse for some people than others, but I'm extremely skeptical that it's actively good for anyone.

I'll be interested to read what they say in Personalized Diet, but I doubt they can convince me that ice cream is healthy for anyone."
6768,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,I SAW GOGGINS WOOOAH.
6769,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,Was just looking for new books to read. This perfect.
6770,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Atomic Habits has been wonderful read for me.
i improved my habits and also started making new habits and track there progress and who doesnt like the Reward part of it haha.
I have been more into data books now a days and trying to understand how data affects business.
Currectly reading ""Data Means Business"" and  ""Stock market"".
What all books are you guys reading currently?"
6771,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,Yoooo!! I have the same shirt! It's super comfy.  Always great stuff master master ken!

6774,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"interesting, you just spoilered book about food and atomic habits. I do not need to read them anymore 🤣"
6775,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Thanks for the amazing book recommendations...I'm sure to read Why We Sleep after this...the way you described it will ensure that! Also would like to remain the same age watching your videos for 100 years more...the one on aging too...

I am not a fan of reading too...but I do prefer these type of books over any novels. Thanks for these suggestions! 😊"
6776,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Hi Ken, are there any books on the topic that you found useless despite being often recommended?

Here's my small list:

1. How will you measure your life? By Clayton Christiansen

2. Never split the difference by Chris Voss who is the former FBI negotiator

3. You are a badass by Jen Sincero - a very powerful self-help book

4. The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel - so far my favourite book about financial literacy"
6777,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"While in general on par with most, I always wonder why people are so sure about what a ""good"" habit is. So in general I think everyone should be make sure about that before jumping to conclusion on how to achieve these ""good"" habits as efficient and fast as possible. Just an example: is efficiency something that is always better than inefficiency.
That's why I highly recommend something like:
Henry Miller - Colossus of Maroussi
Nietzsche - On the Genealogy of Morality
Beauvoir - The Mandarins 
etc.
Made me wonder whether optimization is the holy grail :)"
6778,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"It's good to see you uploaded this video! I'm always looking for great book recommendations on the topic. I'm going to add Digital Minimalism, Breathing, and Why We Sleep to my next reads list! I've read Atomic habits and it's indeed a great book.

I've read a few personal development books, as I'm fascinated with the topic and always looking to increase my productivity and personal character. The first book I've read on the topic that got me started with everything else is ""7 habits of highly effective people."" That book did the same for me as Atomic habits did for you. I recommend it, it's a very interesting read.

Btw, I'm halfway of reading Getting Things Done. It's a great book, and it has added immediate value to my life already. I recommend it, too."
6779,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"I am ashamed of not being able to recommend any book in this regard :3 I will definitely be reading more starting with this list ! ( I share Ecstacy's disappointment btw Haha ) 
I think I'll start with Atomic Habits ! Thank you Ken :)"

6783,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,Great recommendations ☺️
6784,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Love me some ""Atomic Habits"", I think it looks like a favorite here in the comment section as well!

Also was looking at your books on your bookshelf (#creeping) and saw you had ""Storyworthy"".  I just started this book!"

6787,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,Appreciate you coming out as Pro-Book in the last podcast. We should all protest now.
6788,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Hello sir, thank you for your recommendation. I just bought a book named Getting Things Done -- The Art of Stress-free Productivity by David Allen, hopefully it is good. It was recommended by someone else. Also, recently read The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley, it really helps to establish a healthy idea on wealth and wealth management. Best Regards."
6789,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,Great list! Thanks for sharing :) I am afraid to read the one about sleep though.... 😅
6790,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,Love the thumbnail... will take people's breathe away.
6791,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Atomic habits is my favorite definitely. I am currently reading "" Crushing it"" By Gary vee"
6792,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"I recommend ""How Not to Die"" by Michael Greger"
6793,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,I was expecting some thirsty people in the comment section but it's a little too clean kek
6794,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Great video Ken, Atomic Habits and Why We Sleep are definitely some of my favourites. 
I also particularly enjoyed The Courage to be Disliked / Happy 😊"
6795,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,Just Osho will change your life. No other book needed.
6796,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Almost forgot: I do have a suggestion of a book in english: It's ""the bullet journal method""  by Ryder Caroll. Most sites who talk about bullet journaling have actually no idea what the method is truly about which is about focusing on important matters in your life and WHY they matter. 

Not having something beautiful or gating people out because ""your stuff is no bullet journal"".
Ie: I do mine using small binders and not a notebook and it works for me but people have told me ""this is not a bullet journal"" and yet it's still a pretty functional bullet journal.

Also, in the same vein of atomic habits, I can recommend Elasitc habits by stephen guise, he's my go to guy when it comes to habit. And this book is about having habits that adapt to the circumstances of your life. How to maintain one when things are very hard and how to maximize the benefits of a good day."
6797,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"Yoo Ken what a flex in the thumbnail!! 🤠🤠🐢🐢

Loved your recommendations and have read Atomic Habits myself and am considering to read Digital Minimalism. Well here are some of my recommendations which are about life and I guess psychology: 

1: *Man's search for meaning*- A must read definitely
2: *What Every body speaks* - How to read Body language
3: *Beyond Freedom and Dignity*- BF Skinner classic (an interesting read)
4: Works by *Dostoyevsky* and *Tolstoy* - you know the classics 🐢
5: *So you have been publicly shamed*- Definitely something for the social media world.
6: *Influence: the psychology of persuasion*
7:  *As a man thinketh*  

Well the list does go on but I hope this will be of some value to you 🐢🐢🐢"
6798,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,"You might also be interested in the practice of self hypnosis. It helps clear the mind, relax the body and increase mental focus for, say, doing machine learning ;)

The problem is my main source of information on the subject is from a french guy named Benjamin Lubszynski. He has a youtube channel unfortunately in french and two books, also in french.

That being said I'll look for english sources for this as I believe it is a lovely habit from which everyone can benefit and its benefits are many :) (greater than meditation as it takes its source from the subconscious which makes it both more accessible than meditation but also much more effective)."
6799,7 Incredible Books That Transformed My Health and My Life,Wow was thinking to ask you about your book collection after seeing that data science course video.. and here we go..

My second question is how deep into the math behind the ML algorithms should I go and understand, especially when it comes to more complicated models (and deep learning models). If my goal is to become a business oriented data scientist (and maybe a sports analyst), Is a basic understanding of the math behind models enough ? Thanks for all the hard work"
6816,🌶 Hot Topics in Tech: Data Science Explained #SHORTS,"Hi Ken! I have a question for you if you don't mind, I am starting my first data science project for potential employers now while searching for jobs.

Data analytics in business
Data Science

Are these good to go for, if you are planning to become a data scientist?"
6895,Should You Get A Masters in Data Science?,"Hey Ken, just wanted to say you make some amazing content.  I was also wandering whether you think I should rather complete another Bachelors degree or  straight onto a Master in Data Science? I've ended up completing my Bachelors in Sport and Exercise Science and am currently the middle of my research project in Biomechanics.  Although I enjoy the field I feel like my contributions if I stick with it will be limited to academia and find the idea that my articles may rarely ever be looked at quite disheartening. If I return to university I was considering completing a bachelor of actuarial studies not quite the same as data science but quite closely related."
6896,Should You Get A Masters in Data Science?,"Hi ken, you are making a great content regarding this data science. I saw one of your video of how to study DS in a step by step process and i am currently following it. I recently graduated and i am thinking of doing MS in data science. Can you suggest some good universities for that ?"
6897,Should You Get A Masters in Data Science?,"Hi Ken thanks for the info. How do organizations value certifications from udemy, coursera and datacamp? It seems that they are much less rigorous in assessments than other formal studies through universities. Besides, if there are so many people pursuing the same route, do you think employers would give preference to those who studied data science in top unis ?"
6898,Should You Get A Masters in Data Science?,Hi Ken! I have a bachelors in chemical engineering and some years of work experience. I’m interested in making the switch to data science. Do you think a masters might be worth it for someone in my position? Most masters I’m considering are 30k-60k total.
6899,Should You Get A Masters in Data Science?,"A lot of the described disadvantages aren't as bad in the UK. Courses are all around £10k (12k dollars) and we're given standardised student loan. Also, once you're accepted into the course, you tend to be allowed to select any module you want, even if there are advertised prerequisites. 
Helpful content nonetheless. I was accepted into three programmes and realised that only one of them had a robust syllabus. Strangely enough, it also happened to be the cheapest one! The cash grab thing is true."
6900,Should You Get A Masters in Data Science?,"Hello If I do MS in Data science or Data analytics, I will get job in HR analytics or in HR field ?"
6901,Should You Get A Masters in Data Science?,"Hey Ken, I'm a computer science major right now, but my school came out with a 4 + 1 major masters program, where you get a computer science major and data science masters, its just one extra year. Do you think that's more worth it then a boot camp or cert? it's fairly new,  about 30k."
6902,Should You Get A Masters in Data Science?,"Hi Ken! Thanks for the video. I come from a humanties background and as of now don't exactly know what kind of position I want after a MSc in Data Science and Business Analytics, but I think the skills can be applied to a wide range of sectors and industries and I can explore more during grad school. In a nutshell, I do want to gain these skills and open more doors in the future, do you think this is a less mature/thought-through motivation to pursue such a degree?"
6903,Should You Get A Masters in Data Science?,"Hi Ken, very informative video. Would a general MS in Analytics be equivalent to a MS in Data Science? Or would employers prefer someone with a MS in Predictive Analytics versus someone with a MS in Analytics?"
6904,Should You Get A Masters in Data Science?,"I am studying BCA (Bachelor of Computer Application) in India .
I want  to have a ms in data science from a institute. But in our country (India) all institute provide PG diploma in Data Science. Can you guide me in which country and which institute i can get a degree MS in Data Science with a handsome salary of job."
6905,Should You Get A Masters in Data Science?,"I have a masters in exercise science, but I want to get into data science/machine learning. I am looking at the University of Denver's masters program in data science and they do have courses in machine learning but from what I read in some of their course descriptions they use Java instead of Python or R.  I seem to read that Python and or R are the two main programming languages used in data science. Being that I have no experience in the computer science field should I go for this type of program or should I go for a masters in computer science at my local university which also has courses on advanced algorithms and machine learning?"
6906,Should You Get A Masters in Data Science?,Would you say a masters in business analytics is worth it?

6918,The YouTube Algorithm EXPLAINED! (Tips from a Data Scientist),"Hi Ken
I actually worked on building a simple Youtube Video categorization model using just the title and description. When I plotted those text metadata using a T-SNE plot I could see that videos from the same category where not compressed together rather they were scattered around forming occasional blobs of different category videos clustered together.

So, I wanted to know that how does Youtube actually categorize its videos because 'title+description' doesnt seem to be very specific.

I know some Youtubers put their ads/sponsorships at the end of the video but if someone doesn’t watch that last part of the video because of the ads is that the end of the video? I know the ending screens can take up the last 10 seconds of the video so is it one minute till the end of the video or 10 seconds to the end of the video.
6926,The YouTube Algorithm EXPLAINED! (Tips from a Data Scientist),This is a compelling content. I have been watching a lot of videos that say it is just about the algorithm. Yours is different.

6964,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),"Hey Ken. Nice video. I am an experienced economist. I have a a BA and MA  in economics and finance. I have worked for 8 years in economics and econometrics. This basically entails extensive data analysis and statistics around economic issues, so I am very good with statistics, regressions, inference, and causality (a big thing in econometrics). However, in economics we mostly use Stata as the go to software. I am really interested in shifting to data science as I have a huge passion for data analysis. I need to learn the languages commonly used in data science (R, python…) but I am strong on the statistical background. Any insights on what’s best and where to start keeping in mind that I am currently a full-time economist. So the transition has to be gradual or more like a side-hustle in the beginning. Thanks"
6965,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),"Just started a Module in my Google Data Analytics Course where I get to learn about Data Visualisation. As a kid I was always into sketching, colouring or some form of Imagery. As I grew up I could identify and nurture my storytelling skills. So far, with whatever I have read and learnt about Data Visualisation it seems like a party for an art and design lover like me who also loves storytelling. And this video of yours nails it to the end. I just hope I do well and make the most of data visualisation Module now."
6966,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),"Just found this channel. Im an Applied Math major exploring my options. I gotta say, the formatting and filming are done very well! Seems like a trustworthy place that i'll be coming back to.

6975,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),I was very surprised and impressed when I saw the graphs and visualisation in trading apps... They are very helpful to understand many tiny aspects and indeed looks beautiful 😍
6976,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),What’s more important for data science …. Computational and applied math or math statistics?
6977,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),Great video Ken couldn't agree more man. Data visualisation is the key translation tool for data scientists -> business stakeholders. Keep it up dude
6978,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),"Hi ken
I had a question
how often  do data scientists use object oriented programming in their work?"

6982,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),"Data Visualization is an art and a science in itself! And well, who says no to looking at some beautiful drawings and pictures?
""A graph is worth a thousand tables"" even if the tables are stored in a graph database? 😜"
6983,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),"Data visualization is beautiful and we should say ""YES"" to beautiful things. 😁"
6984,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),I see no lie
6985,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),Dammit I was looking forward to what argument you would give if no 🧐😅
6986,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),"As a product person who loves data and data visualizations I love your video. Maybe one question, how do you work with your data scientist if repeatedly asking for easy to understand dashboards and typically we get dashboards that take minutes to interpret each graph and explain repeatedly? I know product people can be cryptic as well 🤣 love your vids Ken!"
6987,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),"While ""a picture is worth a thousand words"", the RIGHT picture is far more meaningful as many artist / photographers might point out.


I recently did an assessment where lots of questions were about which visualization conveyed a particular point or what statement is represented."
6988,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),"Visuals makes everything understandable and presentable 💯
Very informative ken loving this 🎉"
6989,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),"3:38 The ""papaya plot"" is certainly a great alternative to the ""pie chart"" and ""is extremely effective for conveying complicated info in a digestible way"". 😆
Jokes aside, this is a nice and concise video on the importance of data viz. It is certainly one of the funnest part of a data science project, sometimes I would be lost in the zone of customizing plots for countless hours."
6990,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),"Would this be a correct analogy?
Data Analyst = Front-End

6991,Is Data Visualization Important for Data Science? (A Data Scientist's Perspective),"I love to see Data visualizations in everything ! I remember as a child I used to play soccer on PlayStation 2 a lot, and they had plenty of charts like radar charts for players and teams to rank them by skill (attack, defense, speed, ... ), trees to rank players and clubs in different leagues, soccer fields with different sized circles to show ball possession ... It was awesome, we would literally spend 10 minutes before each match just looking at the graphs to choose the best Formation. I don't think we would've liked PS2 as much without those visualizations, even as kids they generated high value for us as consumers and for the company as a business."

7002,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Solid video for any aspiring data science student.
7003,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Thanku for sharing your experience!
7004,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Hey there. I really hope someone sees this. I just recently dropped out of accounting, i have a 4.0 GPA, so it's not because I didn't perform, I just didn't love it...Now, I'm considering a Masters degree in BI, and I have to admit...For someone who's never ever switched tracks, I'm freaking out...I don't really like excel, I'm scared of coding (I've never done it) and the last time I touched statistics was an introductory class in my first year in Uni...I want to be in marketing later on, but the master's degree in marketing isn't valuable (bad placement rate, and low start salary). BI seems to be something that might give me an edge in marketing, and in an of itself, it's valued on the market and pays well of the bat. I'm really struggling right now, because I'm starting to think I should've stayed in accounting, since at least it was clear what the progression of the career would be...Someone please help me! I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown,"
7005,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Love the video Ken, Good execution! I think I definitely relate to the project demonstration point."
7006,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Could I have a bachelors in industrial engineering and a minor in statistics for data science?
7007,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Can I ask you guys title Suggestion of thesis undergradute in Data science, or analyst field.
I really stucked :("
7008,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Is it a wise move if I give my all to sql, i dont know, I just like the language. I am currently on a masters in data science program, and they are literally teaching us R, Python and Sql at the same time. please give me an advice"
7009,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Excellent Insights and so relatable. I switched from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science and if there is one word that can describe the transition its 'persistence' and only 'persistence' :)
7010,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Hey...Hope you're doing well. Forrest Knight brought me here. Looking forward to watching your videos. Thanks.
7011,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Thanks for the promo code! ☺️
7012,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Great video! Im thinking of going into consuming and just watched your video with Gleb, but I was wondering if you can do more a couple videos on data freelancing and getting clients and stuff like that because I don’t even know what I’m marketing honestly."
7013,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"If I had no regrets I wouldn't being here on your channel. If I wouldn't fail at university, I would not start to become Data Scientist."
7014,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"This is so useful, I love you videos! What are your thoughts on SAS? I heard it is an industry standard and a lot of big companies use it. Do you think its worth devoting time to?"
7015,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"I do not have any data science friends. If anyone is down to learn and study with me and is pretty chill, shoot me a message on discord at Losebow#9664"
7016,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Mate You are Discouraging me 😒
7017,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"I think you cannot just compare now and back then; there are a lot more quality courses and people who are willing to share, i.e. handsome you. Also, it has become more acceptable and normal for people to take up online courses rather than attending physical schools."
7018,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Ken Jee, thanks for sharing your personal experiences! In grad school right now, and I love listening to your podcasts on my runs <3"
7019,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"I hear ya on languages. In the Intro to Data Science course I used to teach, we positioned the class as ""language agnostic"" so I ended up doing every demo in Excel, R, and Python. It made my head spin and I was constantly crossing up the syntaxes. Working only in Python for the past year has made all the difference."
7020,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Hey Ken, I just started an online data science degree this past Jan.  I was wondering a couple things:

Why exactly was the design principles course so helpful?  This is also in my curriculum.

Is it uncommon to continue taking classes WHILE working internships?

I work full time and am nervous about leaving my job to find internships without the promise of a job afterwards.  Was thinking I might start searching for internships once I only have a few classes left so that I might finish the degree during the internship."
7021,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Focusing on one language at a time. I feel. I had to go back and forth between Python and R because of internship and coursework which made it take longer to build on understanding. In addition, one thing that isn't really talked about is mental health in data. I feel that mental health and burnout have been two ways that led to my own personal career setback. These would be great topics that I believe could add significant value.

Thanks again for being transparent!"
7022,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Thanks for sharing the experience to us.
7023,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Nice video Ken!! I loved the philosophical ending words.
7024,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Hi Mr. Ken,
I am a 15 year old junior high school student currently living in Dubai and I am planning to be a data scientist in the future. I am most likely going to be doing an undergraduate for computer science at ubc. I wanted to ask if you have any advice for me as I am starting my journey in one year.
I also wanted to add that I find your content very helpful and hope that everything goes well with you."
7025,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"ALTERNATE QUESTION: If you were starting from scratch today, but with the knowledge of your regrets and struggles (keeping in mind that everything has changed since you began and continues to evolve) how would you proceed? More specifically, how would you ""learn Python""? With so many ways it can be applied, it's like saying ""learn to use a computer""."
7026,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"My biggest obstacle is that companies have a hard on for prior experience. If you haven’t done a project with their specific technology stack then they look elsewhere even if you’re the better data scientist or data engineer, whatever you want to call it, in terms of learning new things, being motivated, taking pride in your work, etc."
7027,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,I'm just now starting a library info science masters with a certificate of advance study in data science with a full ride. I am def nervous and hope I can follow through with the data courses. I wish I knew more about how to get by in these data science courses bv I'm worried about maintaining a GPA for scholarships.
7028,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Like 108º
7029,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Greatly explained
My regrets :
- structured my studies and followed it religiously .
- always changing resources and not sticking to one.
- wished I knew before that working as intern in startup that your role doens't define what work you will working in a startup can be bug Hassel and proper guidance is something which lacks but of course you get a lot of knowledge in these experiences."
7030,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"I believe we usually tend to choose an optimal strategy based on our present situation, whose benefits are only seen on the long term. For example in Morocco, I have to get a Master's Degree, but online courses, assignments and exams take all my time and energy .. Yet I can't just decide to study DS at home and not pursue a Master's Degree because I won't qualify for most job offers. At the same time, pursuing Economic Analysis and Modelling is what introduced me to DS .. Although studying free a home would have saved me so much time, money and effort, I'm not sure I'd follow that path if I wasn't already formally stuyding .. I also believe that you wouldn't bother us today on YouTube if you were socially active in University or studied just one Degree :3 so as you said, I'm Glad things turned out the way there are now"
7031,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"I was also confused between R and Python but I started learning Python because the jobs or work which I want to do is more in Python 😀

Hey, If you don't mind I have one question... Why you learned C, Java as you are in data science? 

66daysofdata is a nice community🙌🙌

What are the different ways of documenting the journey? Like YouTube videos or blogs. Anything else you can suggest?

Literally I'm also regreting not doing projects during college and I was also failed to utilise my lockdown time. These I joined a company so I have less time sometimes.

But, now is also good. Whatever happens it happens for good. Keeping this mindset helping me to go ahead 😀"
7032,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Ah Ken, I have this immense love for this field. I'll be trying to apply more from now on. I wish there were more free resources like kaggle. In Pakistan we don't even have Paypal to access these course. Well thank you for this video ❤️🥺 now gonna go back to work"
7033,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Heck yeah!  I fell into the same trap here with R & Python!  Luckily I finally figured out to just go with only the better language! hehe
7034,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Finished round 2 of #66daysofdata the day before. What did I gain by doing so people might ask. Well I just got accepted to work on a DS/ML project at my company yesterday. No online course/bootcamp could give you results that quickly I guess😂.
7035,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"0:20 Let’s go to 1M! 🚀 🚀 7:55 This resonated with me as well, obstacles or failures helps us improve, as Ray Dalio puts it Pain + Reflection = Progress. Oh and just noticed the nice Brachiosaurus in the background!"
7036,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Thank you for sharing your regrets. Some of them also apply to me.
7037,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Well done Ken!
7038,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Hope your channel grows,you really try to help the community a lot."
7039,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Seeing your videos motivates me.
7040,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,That wink 😆😍
7041,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Really struggling with retention. That's my biggest struggle. 

Biggest regret was not starting sooner. At 40 I'm worried about potential agism and not being able to move to accept a job if I'm ever able to finally grasp any of this."
7042,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Solid execution! I love it haha
7043,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Yeah, these points are worth considering in my journey as well. Thanks for sharing, Ken."
7044,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"I am just starting. So, I don't know what is my regret. I am starting with python and I do write code but I get distracted and start learning something else . Youtube suggested so much. But then I reprimanded myself and try to learn the first thing I had started. In hope that I'll be able to get hold of the things."
7045,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,"Q: 01:00 and 6:52 what happened to the T-Rex? 
A: He regrets (see what I did there?) being a carnivore so changed to a Brachiosaurus to get some of those juicy papaya! 🤣"
7046,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,First comment yes! 💪 going to watch the video now...
7047,My Regrets as a Data Science Student,Waiting for this to shoot up.

7050,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,I disliked this video because of the dumb clickbait title
7051,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,"Thanks a lot ken I was feeling very nervous and disheartened after putting 5 days in working and couldn't even complete half of the business analysis. 
I was very confused . But after watching this video i got some real motivation. Thanks alot my friend♥️"
7052,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,"Thanks Ken, you're genuine input created high spirit for newbie like me entering the DS world."
7053,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,Hey Ken . Its ok for the experienced data scientists . I have observed myself constantly looking for help on google or stack overflow on simplest topics as well. Can you make video for beginners on how to practice the data wrangling so it can become strong neural path for the same tasks. Thanks 😊
7054,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,This is one of those open secrets. Presenting is no problem. A live coding session is scary.
7055,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,But our mentor Ken already unveil this secret 😊.
7056,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,Thank you for sharing github link it is really helpful.... most of time our time get consumed in finding how to get started........
7057,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,"Nice topic, I love your channel"
7058,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,2:00 good idea
7059,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,"I started keeping a journal (handwritten) of various functions and methods that I knew I would want to use again.  The journal is long, but it made for quick reference when I encounter a problem that I know I’ve solved before.  

I think the feeling of inadequacy comes from often seeing the finished work of very experienced people and never seeing the process.  It almost makes it look like they can do it all in one go without referencing anything."
7060,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,Thanks a lot!
7061,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,Great info! I wonder if we are also allowed to use these resources during an interview?
7062,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,"Best video ever!!! I feel so much better about learning to become a data scientist. And now I have a great resource I can use for my own code. Ken is awesome!!!

7063,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,"I love it when the video is exactly what's on the title. 
No dragging and down to the point. 
Thank you sir"
7064,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,"Completely agreed. However, would this be a step after you get proficient with coding in python and stats/machine learning algorithms for coding interviews?"
7065,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,"I don't think these kind of ""secrets"" are taking credibility from data scientists. It is not about memorizing every bit of code. It's about knowing how to get help and knowing what you are looking for."
7066,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,Makes me think you need a good note-taking program that you are comfortable referencing.
7067,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,"You don't know how happy this video made me. I currently have impostor syndrome and I plan on applying to an internship next week. I was worried I wouldn't know enough and that I won't be able to perform to their expectations. Knowing that it's common for DS to reference their old works or constantly use outside resources is such a big relief.  If I end up getting a job, its because of you! You've contributed so much to my growth. 

Thanks for everything Ken!!"
7068,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,You are a hope to all aspiring data scientists.
7069,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,"I clicked the like button right before you mentioned it! 😆 
I found this video at the perfect time. I'm at that stage where I realize how much I don't know and feeling overwhelmed and that I'll never be able to recall all of the information I've been learning. It's great to know that I'm on the right track and doing the same thing with how I am organizing my notes. New mantra: It's not shameful that I can't remember everything."
7070,The Secret Data Scientists Don't Want You to Know,This video makes me feel comfortable. Knowing that referring to outside resources constantly is completely normal sheds my guilty feelings...Thank u ken....

7108,5 Proven Strategies to Break into a Data Science Job,"Hi Ken, tell me what you think of my idea.
Given my age and current educational background and the fact that we are in a pandemic and many companies are probably mitigating risks in regards to hiring, trying to find myself an entry-level data analyst job will probably be next to impossible. I have decided that I am going to be starting a master's program this fall. I am deciding on Colorado State University Global's AI and Machine Learning master's degree or going with Eastern University's Master's in Data Science. Eastern's  program is brand new, so it probably does not have many reviews yet. It seem like it is a program for all ability levels, so I'm not sure of the robustness of the program. I am thinking of going for a double master's in this field. I could go the PhD route if I'm going to have a master's already by the end of next year, but I do not feel like setting myself back several tens of thousands of dollars more in debt for doctorate school. I figure the job market is not going to get any where near normal until at least 2023. With so many people out of work and looking for new jobs, I feel it is going to get super competitive. With the rock bottom tuition for some of these programs helping to minimize student loan debt, I might as well use this time to rack up a master's degree or two in this field."
7109,5 Proven Strategies to Break into a Data Science Job,"Hello Ken, thanks for the video. I've been following you since you were 5000 subs, but I had never seen your resume and I didn't know you started on data science because you were a golfer. I am a tennis player and I have been searching a lot about data science and I would like to start applying it on my tennis game. I saw an app called SwingVision that does the statistic by its own, but unfortunately is just for Ios and I just have android. I would like to get a free software or build one. Do you know any? If not, what would I have to learn to build a software like that? Thanks for your help"

7115,5 Proven Strategies to Break into a Data Science Job,"Ive worked in Data Science for three years now. When you go to that interview my best advice is to be studied up and give good examples of practical experience. It is quite rewarding I went from 58k starting now at 72K three years I pay 0 dollars and 0 cents for health care that is a Cadillac Plan I get 10 sick days a year and 3 weeks Vacation Time. I do not pay for food when I am at work they cater in meals. Heres some personal advice to prepare yourself. Kick all bullshit people and situations out of your life. This includes All Social Media you need to focus and be prepared. You need to really be strong in systems and troubleshooting skills of those systems. DO NOT TAKE YOUR PHONE IN THE INTERVIEW. TAKE A NOTEPAD AND HAVE YOUR OWN PEN SUGGEST A FISHER SPACE PEN IT WILL WRITE AND NOT MAKE YOU BE IN A PEN BEGGING SITUATION>. My interview was five people that you need to convince you are worth a shit.  I do remember a remarkable moment in the interview where I was asked about Social Media I stated that I had closed all my Social Media Years prior. 

These systems are complex and use many inter relationship application features to communicate data  to one another. You need to be able to show this understanding. You need to be able to find and isolate issues in that system. You need to be able to answer questions about particular data points and features. This is not for everybody. I'm just going to lay it all out here if you fuck off at  work and arent truly focused dont apply. If you are the type of person who just wants a check who thinks showing up is good enough dont apply. This is why they have so many people at the interviews for these jobs. They are trying to see if you have what it takes and are disciplined. I used number four applied with in the company. Yes they paid for the training after selection. By the way the criteria was stiff 90% weighted grades required or you would be let go. There was 19 people in the class 15 made it.

When I was hired 5 people were hired at the same time 4 of those have been fired. Theres good money to be made here if you show you are serious they will keep raising your pay. Reasons for firing one was on FaceBook all the time. One was a Narcissitic Drama Queen. One had tons of excuses for not completing Tasks. One got fired for Sexual Harrassment.  These people have good money to pay and they know it. PACK YER POOP TIGHT thats Marine speak for SHIT together."

7128,5 Proven Strategies to Break into a Data Science Job,"How Much Math do I need in Data Science?
Math skills are essential in data science and machine learning
 
I. Introduction

If you are a data science aspirant, you no doubt have the following questions in mind:

Can I become a data scientist with little or no math background?

What essential math skills are important in data science?

There are so many good packages that can be used for building predictive models or for producing data visualizations. Some of the most common packages for descriptive and predictive analytics include:

    Ggplot2
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Scikit-learn
    Caret
    TensorFlow
    PyTorch
    Keras

Thanks to these packages, anyone can build a model or produce a data visualization. However, very solid background knowledge in mathematics is essential for fine-tuning your models to produce reliable models with optimal performance. It is one thing to build a model, it is another thing to interpret the model and draw out meaningful conclusions that can be used for data-driven decision making. It’s important that before using these packages, you have an understanding of the mathematical basis of each, that way you are not using these packages simply as black-box tools.
II. Case Study: Building A Multiple Regression Model

Let’s suppose we are going to be building a multi-regression model. Before doing that, we need to ask ourselves the following questions:

How big is my dataset?

What are my feature variables and target variable?

What predictor features correlate the most with the target variable?

What features are important?

Should I scale my features?

How should my dataset be partitioned into training and testing sets?

What is principal component analysis (PCA)?

Should I use PCA for removing redundant features?

How do I evaluate my model? Should I used R2 score, MSE, or MAE?

How can I improve the predictive power of the model?

Should I use regularized regression models?

What are the regression coefficients?

What is the intercept?

Should I use non-parametric regression models such as KNeighbors regression or support vector regression?

What are the hyperparameters in my model, and how can they be fine-tuned to obtain the model with optimal performance?

Without a sound math background, you wouldn’t be able to address the questions raised above. The bottom line is that in data science and machine learning, mathematical skills are as important as programming skills. As a data science aspirant, it is therefore essential that you invest time to study the theoretical and mathematical foundations of data science and machine learning. Your ability to build reliable and efficient models that can be applied to real-world problems depends on how good your mathematical skills are. To see how math skills are applied in building a machine learning regression model, please see this article: Machine Learning Process Tutorial.

Let’s now discuss some of the essential math skills needed in data science and machine learning.
III. Essential Math Skills for Data Science and Machine Learning
1. Statistics and Probability

Statistics and Probability is used for visualization of features, data preprocessing, feature transformation, data imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, model evaluation, etc.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard deviation/variance, Correlation coefficient and the covariance matrix, Probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal), p-value, Baye’s Theorem (Precision, Recall, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve), Central Limit Theorem, R_2 score, Mean Square Error (MSE), A/B Testing, Monte Carlo Simulation
2. Multivariable Calculus

Most machine learning models are built with a dataset having several features or predictors. Hence, familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important for building a machine learning model.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Functions of several variables; Derivatives and gradients; Step function, Sigmoid function, Logit function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function; Cost function; Plotting of functions; Minimum and Maximum values of a function
3. Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine learning. A data set is represented as a matrix. Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing, data transformation, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Vectors; Norm of a vector; Matrices; Transpose of a matrix; The inverse of a matrix; The determinant of a matrix; Trace of a Matrix; Dot product; Eigenvalues; Eigenvectors
4. Optimization Methods

Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective function, thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order to obtain the predicted labels.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Cost function/Objective function; Likelihood function; Error function; Gradient Descent Algorithm and its variants (e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm)
IV. Summary and Conclusion

In summary, we’ve discussed the essential math and theoretical skills that are needed in data science and machine learning. There are several free online courses that will teach you the necessary math skills that you need in data science and machine learning. As a data science aspirant, it’s important to keep in mind that the theoretical foundations of data science are very crucial for building efficient and reliable models. You should, therefore, invest enough time to study the mathematical theory behind each machine learning algorithm."

7204,Find a Data Science Project With These 3 Techniques,02:40 What were your 10 ideas to improve airline flights?  Just curious.
7205,Find a Data Science Project With These 3 Techniques,"WHAT?!! Good projects cannot be found in your closet, laundry, desk drawers etc ... WHY AM I ALWAYS THE LAST TO KNOW?!!!! More seriously, right now, it's not so much ideas that I have problems with at the moment, it's finding enough data to run them ... yep, that time is closing faster than I thought where I will have to learn to scrape data for myself! Especially since many of the ideas I have are around using specific type of pictures (loads of them fantasy, science fiction .... also had an idea which will requires 'solar punk' pictures, all of that in the name of ART and by using ML :o) ). 

But, more likely, it will be about scrapping for text, especially released scripts from some of my favorite series ... or old books!! ( I wonder if I can do a 'whosdunnit' NLP thingy :o) ) ... so many choices, but doesn't choice imply renouncing some of said choices ? ;o)"
7206,Find a Data Science Project With These 3 Techniques,"You're really starting to get the hang of this YouTube(r) business down! The editing is looking great with the different camera angles and transitions and stuff. Have you considered streaming on Twitch or YouTube for some extra views/content? Resume reviews, portfolio reviews, interview advice/practice, teaching something, etc? I know you put out that course a while ago. Good content in the video by the way. I've been using Kaggle to learn some proper ML techniques and their implementations along with when/how to use them,  and also get acquainted with Python more since I'm an such an R junkie. Playing with some stock data sets on there has been good for me, but I do agree, value or good business value comes from gathering some original data or doing something with some impact. 

I'm currently thinking about trying to build a special app/thingy (currently thinking an RShiny web app) that scrapes data/information on Yugioh's card collecting/valuation website and then so someone can enter what cards they have and how much (ignoring PSA value) and then it'll autopopulate the current valuation cell next to it or something. One small note, and I hope this doesn't come across as offensive, but I personally thought that the camera angle/cutaway/transition at around @6:45 was a bit awkward, as it looked like you were speaking but there was an audio lag or something. Very well could just be something due to my internet, but it took me out a little bit if you know what I mean. Nonetheless though, great video and great content. This channel has been immensely helpful and inspiring to me. Keep up the good work! Hopefully this large comment adds valuable data to your corpus you're building. Sorry for the special characters you'll have to get rid of when you tokenize and clean the data lol."
7207,Find a Data Science Project With These 3 Techniques,"Spending a bit of time to find a good idea definitely is worth it!
Once you find something you are truly passionate about, the motivation can sometimes be limitless.
In my opinion, one great project is worth more than a few okay ones, because the passion can really shine through.

7225,Find a Data Science Project With These 3 Techniques,smashed the like button...😉👍
7226,Find a Data Science Project With These 3 Techniques,"In my opinion, you should stick to the field you are interested in. And data should be complicated enough to be worth analyzing, not like two columns. But to get both the data and the idea is the biggest problem for me so far. I either have the idea, but it's nearly impossible to find any decent amount of data or there would be lots of data, but on a topic that I've never found the least exciting. Sometimes data isn't complicated enough for a project. For instance, I do monitor used cars sales on a regular basis, I just love reading about cars, comparing them. But the tricky thing is, there are like 5 or 6 variables to utilize, like mileage, color, horsepower, year produced etc. It's more than enough for eda, but there is not much room for machine learning project. The only interesting idea I came up with (apart fromobvious linear regression) is to analyze, whether mileage is real or not based on the price, number of owners etc. It seems like some fields are inferior in terms of generating data, than others"

7228,Find a Data Science Project With These 3 Techniques,"Wow, the video editing is amazing Ken! Lot's of nicely placed puns and humor. I totally agree with your advice that coming up with project ideas is a great skill to have. In academia, one of the most important skills to be acquired during graduate study is essentially this skill of coming up with project ideas (finding solutions for solving biological data problems).

7315,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),Literally awfull puns
7316,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),The puns in the intro though.
7317,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),"I'm familiar with git from a software development side.  My question is for data science what do you add/track in your epo?  Do you track the entire working tree so that output files dont need to be regenerated for each contributors (e.g. if you have slow running scripts). It do you only ""add"" the source data and scripts so that each person needs to run everything in their local copies?"
7318,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),You are so cute in this peach shirt. Ok I know I’m off the topic. I will focus on the DS part.😅
7319,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),"I am from non programming background, I have already started learning about Git and Github commands. Hope this will help me in near future."
7320,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),"Simplest tutorial to use git.
git clone ""kenyoutubechannel"" 
git add my_comment
git commit ""Commit to thank Ken""
git push
😁😁"
7321,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),"Did you leave out mentioning your own github repository on purpose? 
Also, was it an oversite the not mention github's opensource community as a resource?"
7322,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),"Ohh!!! I was confused between git and Github, Obviously due to lack of knowledge but now the idea is clear. I will watch this video again while implementation it or when I will actually use git for storing projects. Also thank you for git resources..."
7323,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),Very clear and descriptive Ken!

I just don't git it."
7329,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),"Big brain jokes right there 😂 , this video made everything really clear to me ! thank you Ken !"
7330,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),GitHub desktop is friendly and easy for the beginners like me. No need to memorize the command lines. Tend to forget it if not used often.
7331,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),"This was entertaining!  Btw, I saw your name on the DS Go schedule tomorrow! I'm so excited to hear from you there! I'm that GA Data Science recent grad that's been stalking your channel lately :D"

7335,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),Please also explain Git Bash to people who use Windows.
7336,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),"Hi, great video, some tips for the reader from what I learned from work: 
1. I recommend to start including git in every project you do, I didn’t do that, but I wish i did. It helps like ken said with version control, and easier changes publishing instead of going online and going through a whole process, and also ur gonna use it at work for sure so might as well practice.
2. He’s using GitBash, idk if it was mentioned and I missed it but that’s the command line interface to use git. It’s also good cause it uses Bash so if u know Linux/Ubuntu it’s be easier to use. I use the same but there are others if you don’t want to start with a command line like VsCode, Atom, GitHub Desktop (although I recommend Bash). 
3. use Git Status pretty much after every command because If ur in ur own branch, and want to switch to another one, all your work will be lost if not committed or stashed first. 
(Git Stash is just what it sounds like, temporarily stashed or saves your changes to the side so u can do other work and then Pop later)."

7359,MARCH MADNESS - Will My Machine Learning Model Beat Your Bracket?,my rant: I think more important ones are matchups - eg one team can win all games all the time vs another team but loose every game to other teams + home court advantage - think betting odds already do this already? and they have a big team of coders/ prob analyst I'm guessing.

7408,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"Hey Ken,

Thank you so much for all the work you put in your videos. 
Back in May, I started my data science journey after 5 years in project management and I was kind of lost on what path to choose. Following your advice, I started online courses, then worked on Kaggle projects, and finally built a portfolio. 

Now, 7 months later, I landed my first internship as a data scientist ! What tipped the scales in my favor was the portfolio, which I made thanks to the Hugo tutorial on your channel !

So here, thanks from a grateful subscriber =)"
7409,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,Thank you for this video and resources! I have already knowledge in data science and I found usefull ml engineering lessons
7410,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"Hey Ken, I am finishing a boot camp where by the end of next week I’ll have spent 630 hours over 9 weeks, that’s 10 hours a day, studying Python and data analytics. I will definitely join you in January to keep up the momentum I have gained. I enjoying listening to you in my down time."

Did your comment leaderboard idea come from these 66 days?"
7412,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"Ken, due to lockdown I really wasted a huge amount of time which whereas I was planning to be so productive and to master on DL. However, on that gap, I lost the knowledge I had :)) and added more to my depression and imposter syndrome. Now walking through your youtube videos (you have done quite great stuff when I was not out there ) makes me feel safe that I'm actually not that late and I can start it over, I believe that community is going to have a great impact on me! Thank you, I'm saying this deeply :)"

7420,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"Hi Ken, nice video! I didn't participate in this one but I'll join the discord server and do the next one! Quick question: what video editing software do you use? I see in your description your computer details and the camera you use, and I searched throughout your channel to make sure you didn't have a video talking about this stuff, so I'm sorry if you get asked this a lot, I just am going to be done with my second-to-last semester of grad school this week (!!!) and have like, 2 months for christmas break so I was going to spend some time learning editing stuff so I can hopefully start my own youtube channel soon enough. I can't afford the camera yet, but I don't need that to start. I've got some ideas and I just am curious to know what software you use to edit your videos. Do you have a preamp and a mic with a pop filter you use? Thanks!"
7421,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"I have got an why don't you and Andrew make a video on begginer pack of #66daysofdata like roadmap for beginners for 66days challenge something like that?....
Just a suggestion 🙂💯"
7422,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"@Ken Jee this was an absolute journey so far. I think we can have the version2.0 to be more inclined towards practical implementation. We can form teams on Discors & work towards common goal, improving upon the basic we have learnt so far. 
1. We all can curate a list of projects from multiple domain & decide which one to work & with whom.
Would love to hear your thoughts on this."
7423,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"Thank you @ken Jee for #66DaysOfData. I learned a lot in this challenge. Made projects using Tableau, SQL, Python. Got to know about the data science lifecycle. Looking forward for the next #66DaysOfData 🌟"
7424,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,Loved the intro for this one! Set a really nice vibe for the rest of the video.
7425,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,Thank you 🙏 I was really happy following it #66daysofdata
7426,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,Hey Ken I did a quick quantification of the 66daysofdata hashtag here: https://github.com/dungates/TwitterStats/blob/master/66daysofdata.md
7427,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,Why 66 tho?
7428,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"I started following you before a week.
Lucky that i found a channel which is really ""of my type"".
I really believe connecting is the key whatever amouny of technical excellence you have.
Here, we just get the right mix of technical and non-technical stuff for our self-development!

I started implementing many of the corrections you told.
But sometimes I literally go off mood and the day just becomes a void🙁."
7429,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"I agree, the next iteration will be even better! I also struggled with creating a clear, concise plan for my journey. Now that I have a Notion template to document/plan (thanks for linking the one I created btw!🤗) I know that I will be even more productive during the next round! and the slow zoom-in on your dad taking care of business on the laptop was so funny hahaha love the mix of comedy in your videos. Let's gooooooo!!"
7430,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,The thumbnail!
7431,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"Hey Ken, When I started the 66 days of data challenge my goal was to learn deep learning. I was going to learn it through some paid resources but little did I know that posting everyday would open doors to have recruiters talk with me. I got to speak with recruiters from Amazon, Facebook, and a consultancy group. I have now pivoted to Computer Vision as the niche I want to focus on. I look forward to doing this again in January."
7432,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"The 66daysofdata challenge is actually helping me to get though with my degree thesis too. Seeing as I was doing the 5 min even if I was tired from work, I told myself: ""If I can do 5, I can do 10!"" and then set an extra goal of 5 min of daily thesis progress. Some days are harder than others, but it's working and I plan to finish it by February, and that's something a need to thank you for Ken! You really are an inspiration."
7433,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"Ken please answer my query, 
I am a SE with 1 year of experience, I am learning ML/DS since around 6 months and recently I talked to the management of my company for transition to data science. 
They referred me to some research papers related to the respected domain which had seriously complicated math (look at it https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225708015_Impact_on_inventory_costs_with_consolidation_of_distribution_centers).

I am really overwhelmed with all this and am kind of scared by looking at the same. 
What should I do? Shall I drop the idea of becoming a data scientist or apply in other places with different domain."
7434,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"Thanks for watching everyone! I hope you will join the #66DaysOfData in the future!

7438,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"I joined the initiative and lasted maybe 10 days... This year has been really rough, but I've always had a problem finding the motivation to self-teach. My personal lesson that I learned was to take the ""5 mins a day"" to heart. My flawed plan at the beginning was to spend 2-3 hours everyday watching recordings of a bootcamp course I took to refresh my memory on coding, then dive into projects. I got burnt out super fast, and part of that was because I wanted to match the impressive strides I saw so many people making on Discord. I'll definitely pace myself better next time and not be stingy and actually buy an online course. And I'll definitely be looking forward to joining in at the beginning of next year for the next initiative, with all of these improvements in mind!"

7445,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"Hi Ken, I'm looking forward to the next 66days on linkedin. I had planned to join in the last one, but had trouble with twitter."
7446,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"Oh man! What an excellent and beautiful video! I have learned so much these past few months, become so much better, it blows my mind. And it wasn't just Machine learning either. That being said, being part of the #66daysofdata community has certainly been a very large contributor to this, so many thanks for the opportunity ! :)

And one thing that I found that helps for ... practically everything is something that I learned while watching a very old movie named the ""Silent Flute"".
The script was originally written by none other than Bruce Lee who died before he could shoot it. It was taken over and the 'master' was played by none other than David Carradine. And despite showing its old age,  it's full of wisdoms! 

One of them in particular struck a major cord inside me when David Carradine, playing the master who, according to his student, ""seemed to know everything"" he simply answered with this:

""Every time the sun rises, like the student on their first day of school, I open a blank page in my mind to write the lesson of the day."" ... After which, I wrote this on a blank page and added ""... and have an actual, real blank page ready to write the lesson on it.""

I started this on the 14th of may and ... well ... still doing this every-single-day. It's incredible how much you can learn about ... everything when doing this little exercise and I certainly do like to mention Machine Learning here and there. Like, say, pointing out the importance of iterations in practically everything you can do and learn in life. 

Or use lessons I learned from something else, say art, and apply them to my Machine Learning studies -> The kind that says sometimes it's good to switch to something different. not only does it allows you to go back later with a fresh mind but, even better, for all you know, the other project you'll be working might give you ideas for the first one. 

Just watching this video is bringing back to memory some of the stuff that I have written in this 'book of wisdom' of mine and makes me want to say so many things about it that I won't do it. This post is already getting very long as it is, sorry for the wall of text.  ( come to think of it, I need to write one on how to try to summarize my point of views much more briefly). 

Good luck to everyone for not just your #66daysofdata, not your #666daysofdata but, why not?, your #alifeofdata ;)"
7447,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,It's much effective.👍
7448,6 Lessons from #66DaysOfData,"""Just google everything first."" YES.

And yes, I also suffered from not starting with a plan or consistently sharing what I actually did/learned. Oops. I delegated the first part to kaggle, Data Camp, etc. and that just isn't long term sustainable or even short term optimal. No regrets though. :)"

Im in a weird situation where the stuff im doing at uni is mainly in a team project or it can't be shown as it may be the answer to a potential future assignment (although I probably could just show it anyway).

You do not get the data collection and production skills that really help your projects stand out as a true ""end to end"" project that shows off your problem-solving abilities. I personally love the resource as a place to practice and learn new skills while being able to collaborate and work together with others, however, GitHub has always been my go-to to highlight all the individual work I have done that I want to show off to employers!"
7459,Kaggle vs Github - Which is Best for Your Data Science Portfolio?,"You've done a great job in breaking down the details here, Ken! I agree though that Kaggle has a great community, better than Github. Nice video as always!"
7460,Kaggle vs Github - Which is Best for Your Data Science Portfolio?,Can you send me over a pizza 🙂
7461,Kaggle vs Github - Which is Best for Your Data Science Portfolio?,"Ken, I took out the frustration on the like button. I have been Team GitHub for a while now. After seeing this and a few of your kaggle content, I am going to try Kaggle out. Also, your cooking and your new drone shots look good :)"
7462,Kaggle vs Github - Which is Best for Your Data Science Portfolio?,Best advise from video - start with Kaggle and then turn to GitHub.
7463,Kaggle vs Github - Which is Best for Your Data Science Portfolio?,Here just to report this as my day thirty something for my #66daysofdata... Thank you very much Ken.

7475,Kaggle vs Github - Which is Best for Your Data Science Portfolio?,"Hi completely agree with you.  Also thank you for video. 
I think creating kaggle profile is like ""margherita pizza"" without toppings, GitHub is messy similar to different types of topping & cheese,  & we have to properly add on pizza (similar documentation) but ,  it adds real taste in pizza.  
Finally Own portfolio is tells how well chef  you are in your cooking."
7476,Kaggle vs Github - Which is Best for Your Data Science Portfolio?,Reading some of our minds! I'm up at 2:00am pushing projects to Github and this video has assured me that Github is right for my projects and goals. You're awesome Ken! Bed time now.

7486,Kaggle vs Github - Which is Best for Your Data Science Portfolio?,"Thanks as a beginner I am struggling with how to make my portfolio not to mention kaggle is already confusing ,I have done 2-3 projects, like should I make my own website, or kaggle or GitHub or everything, it is so confusing and time consuming 😣 
Also while I am making project I think of taking notes but that is so time consuming I am already dealing with bugs, at the end I am confused what all should I put in readme

I have done projects not made portfolio yet, mask detection, rasa chat bot and rl path finder"
7487,Kaggle vs Github - Which is Best for Your Data Science Portfolio?,Great information!  I am on Kaggle but not GitHub yet.  Excellent point about it being a skill we need to know.  I will check it out.  It doesn't hurt to have two options!
7488,Kaggle vs Github - Which is Best for Your Data Science Portfolio?,"Ken: Git can be messy; also perfectly spreads tomato sauce on the dough :3 .. Finally we got to see some of ur cooking :) Tina was right you can cook damn good 💙
As for the kaggle vs github debate, I put my projects on my portfolio website, and I chose github over kaggle because of the production part of projects"

7517,What It's Like to be a Socially Distanced Data Scientist (A Day in the Life),Congratulations on hitting 80K (and growing) subscribers. Have you now altered your goal viewing from the traffic/analytics on your channel?
7518,What It's Like to be a Socially Distanced Data Scientist (A Day in the Life),"This seems like the kind of top-tier job you would get in silicon valley. I'm from the midwest US and really want to see the more mundane and less glamorous jobs that are out here, since I don't want to leave behind my family and friends and life in indiana to chase a dream job. I know someone who works as a data analyst for CANON and a lot of his work is SQL queries and relational databases and excel spreadsheets. Don't get me wrong -- your job looks amazing -- but it looks really competitive (like 200+ applications per job for these sorts of things) and something that would be near impossible with my background in the humanities.

edit: You know, I just re-read this comment and it sounded rude. So let me just say that I do really appreciate your content and videos!! :-)"
7519,What It's Like to be a Socially Distanced Data Scientist (A Day in the Life),wanted 50k by the end of the year but you're already at 75k! seems like you might get to 100k by the end of the year!

7535,What It's Like to be a Socially Distanced Data Scientist (A Day in the Life),"Hey Ken! Would you say that the typical workday of a data scientist is quite isolated? I love the concept of data science and statistics, but I am also a very social person and am worried that becoming a data scientist will cause me to have an unhappy work life (e.g. constantly sitting in front of a computer the entire day, not enough interaction, etc).

I’m excited to see where my career and this whole data science field will go."
7589,Work From Home Data Scientist: Day in the Life,"I have a wired question; will learning code, for example python become literally common sense eventually? I’ve seen a lot of data scientists carry laptops with perhaps commands of code to help guide them to applying the code to whatever it is they’re coding say on their PC. Is that something that is viable for a data scientist working with code?"

7592,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"All giant companies that controlling most of IT services build on top of one service and that is ""selling data"". They have no choice other than that to listen to us through digital devices."
7593,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"I agree with most of the things you said about the algorithms being so good and that it would be very inefficient for your phone to listen constantly to everything. Specifically, it would not be possible for the speech to text to happen constantly on your phone because of intense battery drain. Similarly it would also be impossible to send voice recording constantly over data because you would notice data usage from your provider. 
However, you can clearly see that when you say the keyword e.g. ""Ok google"", or ""hey Siri"" the phone is actually listening. So google could for example implement a list of keywords, that various companies want advertised, and that would also be silently monitored and when they actually find a match in the list, then they could show the ad. In essence they don't actually analyze all the things you say, they just listen for some keywords that they are interested in."
7594,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,Lmao that thumbnail looked so funny with ears on a phone
7595,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,B.tech in cse data science or btech in ai ml which has better scope and diversity?

7599,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,#1 it's illegal you're basically wiretapping unless the EULA lawyers get you to agree to be monitored all the time *cough *cough.
7600,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"@Ken Jee, if this is really the case that companies (like Google, Facebook) are planning to limit the amount of tracking in one way, does it point to the fact that they are already using other means of tracking and who knows if that's more invasive
As people (aspiring and/or working) in the Data Profession, it's probably up to us to use the algorithm more efficiently 😏, but who can say the same for others?"
7601,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,Which curved monitor do you use?
7602,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"It's also been suggested that phones and other devices aren't actually listening to US but high pitched tones in the audio of TV and radio programming and commercials. Just one more way to get insight into consumers' likes and dislikes. 

Personally, while I don't like the idea of eavesdropping and / or collecting my data (not that we probably haven't already given permission in the fine print of the voluminous service agreements), but I do wish if they ARE going to use the information they're gathering they would do a better job of suggesting things I'd actually want instead of things I DON'T want. Unfortunately we're years away (hopefully) from ""Minority Report"" where sensors identify us as we walk around and deliver targeted ads on the fly."
7603,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Man... now I wonder how they measure the level of friendship you have with someone and if they try to model the parts of your behavior that are unknown to them, through the behavior of the people you hang out with. Insanely cool and scary stuff, and ethically quite questionable."
7604,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"That thing struck me when I was in China, where they have an online shopping app name TAOBAO. Happened to me many times that whenever I discussed some stuff with friends, that thing starts to appear on the TAOBAO app homepage. It looks scary but after such a brilliant explanation things looks understandable.

In a parallel universe: KEN phone only listening to papayas searches"
7605,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,What a naive view of the world... of course they are listening... that's not even a question anymore.
7606,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,stop lying - you're clearly talking to Jeff (I'm pretty sure that's Jeff right?) about how you really wan to buy more papayas and Jeff telling you that you have a problem <3
7607,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,I can’t believe you said “data” instead of “data”
7608,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Great video as always! Ive found a few interesting ideas that have caught my attention over the last year, a.) these huge tech companies should pay us for our data or b.) these huge tech companies should be taxed on their data consumption. Love to hear your thoughts on this!"
7609,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"I think you are a bit naïve - 90% of people who can do something profitable but naughty without reasonable fear of getting caught simply do it. Endless university social experiments have proven this. I think that when they do it, they make sure it is hidden behind layers of plausible deniability - so the component that listens is purchased from a third party and it was some 'bad man hacker from Russia' who broke into the server room through the roof and so on. They will make sure their reputation stays clean even if it means running a 'black ops' operations where the people who do the work have no idea who they are working for. Only an Edward Snowden type event will blow the lid off - and that will be very unprofitable for the individual concerned."
7610,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,For a while less reputable apps were playing and listing for sounds above human hearing limits. They could tell who you were associating with outside of the digital world and then sell that info to whoever wanted it.
7611,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,What about Ultrasonic Cross-Device Tracking?
7612,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Thank you so much for the awesome video. Now I have my thoughts neatly wrapped up and presented, so I can share this with my friends now"
7613,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"I guess the same thing is with location. Once they have access, it doesn't matter weather the phone is on or off."
7614,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,Why are there Papayas every where. I have never heard of Easter Papayas.
7615,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Yes Ken, It is true that if someone came across random ads then it's actually irritating so suggestions based upon our interest are sometimes valuable...

The only point is we need to use technology efficiently which will make the whole process intresting 😉"
7616,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Psh, I ain't worried about companies listening through the phone.... I'M WORRIED KEN JEE IS LISTENING THROUGH MY PHONE, AS I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE THIS SAME VIDEO!!!!  😳😳😳"
7617,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"If I search something (for example chocolate), then soon after, my husband and my son will get ads for chocolate in their phones."
7618,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,Haha hilarious 4:06 and 4:52. Great insights on this mysterious occurrence of this seemingly phone listening in to us. Love the new video format!
7619,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Insightful video. I've got smart ho e devices and I do believe Google assistant has the tech to listen in on my conversations, but if I'm getting value out of it, then I tend to just let it be. I'll use/allow certain platforms to have access and not others. We have somewhat of a control over how our info is shared, but it's not right in front of us. Hope Apple, Google, and others can make it more clear and simple how to control tracking. 

Excellent video to watch before bed. Have a good weekend. 🙏"
7620,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,Great stuff 💯
7621,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"not just listening but spying with cameras too 🤭, on a serious note ken that search history of papayas made me rethink my life choices"
7622,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Great video, Have you seen the social dilemma documentary?"
7623,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Utter bullshit. Speech recognition is computationally cheap, otherwise there wouldn't be such things as Siri. Companies don't pay for these computations, because your phone does them"
7624,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"All I can see and hear is papaya, papaya, and papaya
Great video ken always wondered about this."
7625,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,Totally Agree with you!!! 🙌💯
7626,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Man technology is scary, I can't even imagine where the technology will be in year 2050"
7627,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Hey Ken, just want to say thanks for putting out so much good content. I’m currently working on my first real world project through school for a local company and having channels like yours to reference is a life saver."
7628,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Your explanation makes a lot of sense when you look at it from the outside. The bandwidth needed to listen and store all audio to target ads is beyond comprehension. 

Look, Google gets the lionsshare of their revenue from advertising. I believe it's in the 90% range. If they aren't helping business owners grow their businesses, they stop making that money,  so if they tell you they are going to use less tracking on you, it's not out of the goodness of their heart.....it's because they can accomplish the same goals with less resources."
7629,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Haha love your sense of humor Ken ! For me I don't really mind what they do, I mostly only use LinkedIn and YouTube anyway .. I'd rather watch anime than scroll on facebook.
Btw loved the new video style idea !"
7630,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"They are listening and i can prove it. I don’t use Siri or any voice search. My phone and chat programs and 100% of everything I do on it is in English.  I haven’t so much as typed a French translation into my phone.  However after a night at a friends with our kids I had been speaking a bit of French to him and the kids. The next two days several French ads started appearing when browsing and recommended videos on French started appearing on YouTube.

Now some of you might think, oh it's just that they used the ""friend"" algorithm and figured they would send you ads in french.  Except that I live in Thailand, and I don't get ads in Thai....why?  Because I don't speak any Thai and never have, despite obvious amounts of Thai being spoken around me, I never speak it so it has never picked up my voice speaking Thai."
7631,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"does Siri still listen in constantly? but only for ""hey Siri""?"
7632,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,"Woah, love this. I had this question on my mind for quite sometime. You should debunk data related myths like these on your channel and probably call it data debunk something haha 😅❤️"
7633,Is Your Phone REALLY Listening to You?,The ears in the thumbnail haha

7647,How to Set Up Your Data Science Environment (Anaconda Beginner),It's telling that you had to uninstall and reinstall Anaconda.  I get the impression that these kinds of broken installations are commonplace in Python world.
7648,How to Set Up Your Data Science Environment (Anaconda Beginner),"My User folder has a space in its name so the anaconda installer warns me that several packages will face problems, what to do?"
7649,How to Set Up Your Data Science Environment (Anaconda Beginner),Right now I am trying to install anaconda so will it be fine to use the python 3.8 version? because I heard python 3.7 is a stable version but that is not available on anaconda.
7650,How to Set Up Your Data Science Environment (Anaconda Beginner),"Hello, I have a question about the keras model. My keras model project take long time like 1 day and the data update every week, can we save the model? One more if we can save the model can we update data than going learning with this model or we start over?  Tensorflow v2.4, py v3.8"
7651,How to Set Up Your Data Science Environment (Anaconda Beginner),I also used anaconda during my graduation in my final year project but I just used the prompt for activating conda and then running my project interface but this is good that I can use environments directly.  Thanks for showing all the command details here...
7652,How to Set Up Your Data Science Environment (Anaconda Beginner),I don't get this. You title this video Anaconda beginner and then don't do anything with Anaconda!

7658,How to Set Up Your Data Science Environment (Anaconda Beginner),"Hi Ken, 

Would you script your whole project in Spyder then if you wish to share it copy and paste it to Jupyter with markdown where necessary? I'm just wondering why not skip the middle man and use Jupyter all the time.

Take care thanks for all the great info!"
7659,How to Set Up Your Data Science Environment (Anaconda Beginner),"I just removed all of python, pycharm, anaconda from my computer and followed along. i reinstalled anaconda and then it will not let me open any of jupyter notebook spyder or anything. the error is an import error? please help"

7662,How to Set Up Your Data Science Environment (Anaconda Beginner),"Thanks for this intro and starting with anaconda, it very easy to follow. i had been using jupyter since 365, kind of only one i used. i understand spyder can see the variable and dataframe easily. i have a question for the same code and dataset, which will run faster? spyder or jupyter? Thanks"
7663,How to Set Up Your Data Science Environment (Anaconda Beginner),"It's really  cool to see Python and Anaconda fight in jupyter planet, like an R rated movie,.. Haha"
7664,How to Set Up Your Data Science Environment (Anaconda Beginner),"Two questions (as I haven't installed Anaconda yet) : 
1) Isn't there an Anaconda manager that allows to create and switch to different environments? I mean, you used code lines in cmd but if I'm not wrong that should be done by just clicking some commands in Ananconda navigator. Am I wrong? 
2)Tensorflow is a pain for my python version (3.7). Which python version/environment do you suggest for installing and using Tensorflow successfully?

Thanks"

7746,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),I want to ask one question so this part of series where I get struck because I don't understand it so is it okay that I like follow step by step this video do that ...I mean I still did a project but literally must have copied this thing so I am not sure what's your point view on this?🥺😅
7747,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"Heyy can you make a particular video on to choose which model should be used and like what are the most used model in general so in ML we learn that with great importance 💯
Ps: I am taking too long to complete this series 🥴"
7748,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"Again, nice job. It was really helpful. Now I understand how a model code should look like and I also learned some tricks.

There is only one thing I think could have been better. Sometimes I couldn't understand what you were doing nor why. It felt like I was just watching you code.
I understand it is hard to explain everything while you are debugging or improving the model, but you could have added some explanations while editing.

Anyway, this doesn't take the value of the video. 

Many thanks!!"

7752,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"Thanks a lot for this incredible video. 
I am not able to run the touch command in anaconda prompt probably cuz I work with windows 
issue: 'touch' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
what's the alternative command for touch in windows?
update: I did 'echo .>' command"
7753,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),Congratulations Ken for this amazing videos series ! My huge Thank you for passing all the content in details and providing insights along a project. I'm a big fan of you and you help me out a lot during my journey in the Data Science field!
7754,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),ken can you share some details regarding the project based on nlp and cv. man you videos are the best
7755,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"The content is super cool, just like its author, Ken! :)"
7756,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"This video is a bit hard for me to follow, so I tried some alternative and found someone else already mentioned in the comment, that is to use `Streamlit`, I personally find it easier to use to build the model into a web app compared to flask."
7757,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"Hey, ken 'touch' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file'  how to solve this error? please help!"
7758,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),I am currently working on a data science project and was thinking of wrapping it up in a simple Django site. (more work than Flask but I think worth the effort) Do you usually make APIs out of projects? Does it sometimes come full circle as a full web app? I'm trying to stand out as an applicant.
7759,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"Ken I'm not able to get the model as its showing : Buffer type mismatch 

File ""sklearn\tree_tree.pyx"", line 601, in sklearn.tree._tree.Tree.cinit
ValueError: Buffer dtype mismatch, expected 'SIZE_t' but got 'long long'

could you please help?"
7760,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"Hi Ken,

Could you please make a video on  Covid-19 prediction to attract recruiters post covid 19.

Thanks in advance :)"
7761,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"Nice work, you should do it more often, very practical and informative"
7762,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"Hi Ken. This has been a really helpful series for me!  
But, how did the command ""touch"" work for you? as it appears that it does not function in the Windows OS  and is definitely not working for me."
7763,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"Hey Ken great videos!! I am a relative newbie and up until know I have been following along smoothly with no errors however with the step of running the ""wsgi.py"" file and running then curl X etc in the command line....I am getting the same error you were however the your fix did not work for me (@21:54 time stamp) and I made sure to copy the code you had to the letter.

7768,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),Great content ❤️❤️👍
7769,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"Hey Ken, great video as always! I was wondering whether next you could create a step by step introductory guide to GitHub and how to properly use it to store our projects after creating them on jupyter notebooks!
Looking forward to your reply!"
7770,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"Very excited that we get another video! You're a saint, Ken!"
7771,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"​Sir, can you do a project on healthcare/Medical or 1 video in which we follow your guidelines to do a project on it."
7772,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"Really enjoyed this series. As someone learning the field I loved the practicality of it!

A video on the best resources for learning the right models to use in which scenarios would be great too!"
7773,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"Ohh, it mean we have to learn flask also..  to become a data scientist?"
7774,Data Science Project from Scratch -  Part 6 (Putting the Model into Production),"I thought that this would be the last video of this series,  but I decided to do a BONUS one coming out Friday! That one will be on writing a solid readme for your projects that will appeal to employers!"

7779,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),Simplicity is the best approach.
7780,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),Agree this is such a cool profile
7781,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"I know this is a late reply to this video post. My aim for 2021 is also to build a strong GitHub profile and this video is a starter. Loved Darwin's GitHub profile. Ken, can you please post his GitHub profile link as well, I couldn't find him."
7782,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),I like the Tren Black mention he is one of my favorite tech YouTubers. Probably because he reminds me of myself so much.
7783,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),Your clocks are painfully out of sync in the minute hand
7784,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),I know I’m 3 months late but I think it would be cool to answer comments but only good questions 😁 choose wisely
7785,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Hey Ken, 
I have been working as a Mainframe developer with 3+ years experience. I have been quite well with Python as well. Right now, I have enrolled myself in a DataScience MS course and trying to build my github and kaggle profile. I have made an account in Medium and started blogging as well. But I have never made a website(except using blogger and wordpress). Just wanted to know about your thoughts on having a personal website.
Thanks :)"
7786,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"I agree, this is a very neat and tidy repo, very compact and well documented. Only critism I have is that when I comes to using github in the real world the developer/data scientist will need a good understanding of working with development, staging and production branches which is not demonstrated here. In addition, when it comes to deploying models through cloud services such as aws it is more secure to have everything in its own repo"
7787,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),Is it just me but i am seeing a lot of Indians Here.😁😄
7788,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Hi ken jee thanks for the video
Just a quick question how much tensorflow and tableau needed for a data science job?"
7789,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"If you ever want to review my second attempt at a regression, it is in a gist here. My first one, which was huge was just embarrassing. This one at least gives better results. But I’m not overconfident that everything I star is correct. hope so :) https://gist.github.com/lewiuberg/7b2c750ede0c3e9026ea0dca8e6e1c89"
7790,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Responding to questions from the comments at the end of the video definitely sounds like a good idea to me, thanks for the great videos, really useful content!"
7791,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Thanks Ken for another great video! I agree with you Ken, Darwin's GitHub is very well structured folder-wise, content-wise and format-wise. The plots are visually appealing. The drop-down button is also an awesome feature, I also haven't used that yet 😃"
7792,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),Very interesting.
7793,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Hey Ken, I've a question. Since I saw your video where you built a project from scratch and I discovered pd.apply(), I feel that I've been abusing it. I've read more about the function and sometimes another implementations are faster. When do you decided to not use pd.apply() and use other methods?"
7794,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),Thanks for accepting my invitation on LinkedIn. Can you please review my profile as well?
7795,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Wow ... Great GitHub profile , motivating to create such one 😄"
7796,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),New personal goal : submit a profile to Ken in 6-7 months.(Currently have an empty github).
7797,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"hey ken quick question. When describing ones skills with ML on the resume, is it better to name specific models, or more general techniques? i.e Skills: Machine Learning (linear regression, svm, PCA, etc...) vs. Skills: Machine Learning (Regression, Classification, Dimensionality Reduction etc..). Thanks for all the videos you put out, and thanks for reading!"
7798,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),Responding to good questions at the end is great for everyone who can learn from the questions they didn’t even think of.
7799,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Congratulations to Darwin,very good portfolio! I also browsed it and got very surprised : https://github.com/darwin-a .It's good to know that he got his first job in DS 3 months ago. My portfolio is also a bit different, because I recorded some videos of the last 4 projects."
7800,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),Thanks bro!
7801,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),I feel that incorporating good questions into videos would be good. That way people dont ask the same question over and over again. Also good questions wont get lost as videos get older.
7802,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Hi ken, do you think a github portfolio is better than a personal website that contains all your information and projects ? Or should I do both. Thank you"
7803,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Wow, I actually haven't seen this one repo - multiple projects folders approach so far; that's a pretty neat idea!
Also it would be great if you answer comments at the end of the video, given that there are relevant questions of course. I think that would put even more information into your already very informative videos!
Speaking of questions: Here's one:
So I watched your Udemy course and how you talked about reaching out to recruiters or just in general experienced people and how you should try to schedule a call within a specific timeframe. You also said it's always a good idea to try and give ""something back"", so to offer to the other person some sort of help. My question would be, what type of help can someone offer, when they are a student or just in general less experienced? 

Oh and I'm excited for the 66 days of data science! :) 
Personally I'll probably go for 66 days of machine learning engineering haha"
7804,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),Take one question and a 2-5 minute segment on it would be cool at the end of the video. Even throw in an example. Cheers!
7805,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Again, special thanks to Darwin for submitting his gitub profile!

I'm currently learning IBM Data science Professional certificate and planning to start Python 3 programming from Univ. Of Michigan ( both on Coursera). 

MY GOAL: By the end of Jan 2021, I should be working as a Data scientist. I want to celebrate my birthday (23/02/2021) as a data scientist! 🔥

Would you please guide me through this journey?"
7808,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Hi Ken what would you suggest for variable engineering, EDA and data visualization? Welding etc."
7809,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Hello Ken! I want to thank you for all the great videos you provide that really help us, the ones that are interested in entering the field of data science. I saw a video of yours where you suggested that for landing a job in the field it's good to have like 4 projects: using regression, classification, clustering, and DL or NLP. My question is after I saw the great work Darwin did, is it enough to just focus on like 2 projects or 1 that are/is in our field of interest is? That maybe the number of projects doesn't matter but the quality and the way you present them do?  
Thank you!"
7810,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),Go ahead with responding comments 💯👍
7811,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Love this approach in reviewing, very honest and straightforward"
7812,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),"Before this video, I thought creating more and more repos would actually be a great show off in front of employers, but now I think that I really have to work on my GitHub and organize it. Thanks for this video brother."
7813,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 (Job-Worthy GitHub),I think that would be a good idea. I asked a q on your last video so I'm excited to connect!

7818,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),"Hello, I am in my junior year of a data science degree but I have not had any projects. The internship application period has just started but the only experience I have to show is what I have done for school work. Some queries, some R, tableau and excel. Should I include these to showcase my skills even if they aren't necessarily projects?"
7819,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),"Hello sir 
Can i apply for internship at 2nd year of my college in data science"
7820,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),is it accessible for foreigners as the same for Americans?
7821,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),"A helpful video for me. It will help me to bring positive and necessary changes in my journey of learning data science.

My learning-
Explaining the WHY is really important which shows the purpose of doing something.
Company-specific preparation is important while sending a resume and cover letter.

Ken, correct me if I am wrong but do you think you worked as a consultant in the past which is helping you to be a good communicator or explainer?"
7822,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),"Awesome video Ken, which regression  project is best to do for resume/portfolio?"
7823,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),Thanks for sharing these awesome tips! I was wondering what kind of working positions would be helpful to have when applying to a data science internship. I'm hoping to go to a university that has a co-op program that begins first year but I'm most likely not going to get a data science position that early. Do you have any recommendations for what kind of positions I should look for that would be helpful for ending up in data science?
7824,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),Thanks for the information
7825,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),Thank you for these DS internship vids. I'm preparing for an interview for a DS position rn and you're helping me a lot.
7826,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),"Ken, your style of explanation is awesome, that method of putting large stuff into chunks and explaining it step by step is amazing."
7827,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),You my Rabi. Thanx!!
7828,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),Hey Ken!! Thanks for this great video. I am in a dilemma. I am doing my undergrads (2nd year) on Computer Science and I am really interested in data Science. I have started my journey towards it and almost there to do my own projects (Started doing projects on Kaggle). I have work placement on 3rd year. By then I hope to have some projects done on my own. But I doubt companies hire an undergrad for data science role. I have heard that they prefer master's student. What's your say in this? I don't want to change my career path now.
7829,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),"Hey Ken! I have a question. For internship applications, how complex do the portfolio projects on my resume need to be? For example, there are some datasets (like Kaggle's Titanic) in which I could create a pretty accurate regression model in just a few lines of code, but that obviously doesn't seem like enough to include in a portfolio.
Further, if I'm taking an online machine learning course, and there are 'projects' given but solutions to those projects given as well, I'm assuming that those projects wouldn't be wise to include in a portfolio?"
7830,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),You make things sound less overwhelming while also being real about putting in the work. Thank you for the positive energy brother!
7831,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),I am a mechanical engineer..of no prior knowledge of DS... Doing project as you suggested from kaggle and making it unique..lets see🤞🤞
7832,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),"I have a hard dilemma, where I graduated while having a data analyst internship but wished I did a data scientist internship on top of it during college. I am guessing that my best route should be to land a data analyst role and then work my way up to a data scientist position as I gain more domain and real world experience working with data/working on more projects added on my portfolio?"
7833,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),do companies in the US or Europe hire remote data scientists or analysts from outside the country to work remotely or that role is exclusive for local people and must be in the workplace?
7834,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),When you bring up projects I understand the concept of what a project is but how do I do a project as an undergrad. Should I lookup some project or think more creatively and do something unique?
7835,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),"Hi Ken, I am taking online course on data scientist currently, with a institute known as Simplilearn. Not yet complete the whole course, but I am having preliminary exposure on data science using Python and R. Thinking to apply a data science internship to accumulate my working experience. Do you think it is a good time to apply for internship?"
7836,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),What were your skills and education when you applied for the first internship?
7837,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),When are the internship cycles?
7838,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),Thanks for the video Ken! Do you apply through LinkedIn or prefer applying to the companies directly?
7839,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),"This was so helpful. My background is in biology and cognitive science/psychology and throughout undergrad I've been using Python and R to run a variety of different analyses for hypotheses, research questions and data insights. Most of these don't have a ML component, I'm learning that now. could these projects still be relevant for landing a data science internship?"
7840,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),I truly feel ashamed while typing this text but what do you literally mean saying project? I mean for instance I think an original idea and then collect relatively data from sources then create a model for prediction. Or I just choose a Kaggle Project and try to accomplish the aim as good as I can. Which one does count for a resume? THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCE AND THOUGHTS BTW ❤️ greetings from Turkey
7841,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),Hi! What internship salary someone like you could ask for? I don't want to be fooled by an employer and I don't want to ask too much
7842,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),Sir please suggest best online course for data science.
7843,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),My biggest problem is communication. I'm very bad at communicating 😔
7844,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),I don't usually comment on videos but I just want to thank you for making these videos. I really like the down to earth style with lots of practical advice. Your videos have helped me a lot and I am definitely rooting for your success.
7845,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),"Hey Ken ,can you be elaborate about how and where from you choose the projects? And also how do go about them? Do you learn on the go?"
7846,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),i have mediocre level knowledge on a couple of programming languages. How would i start working on any of the projects that you mentioned in the video?
7847,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),You are doing a great work Ken. Thanks for the video
7848,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),Hi!! I was actually struggling on an assignment for hours together and finally encountered your video..it solved my issues within minutes..I immediately subscribed and ended up on this one..Keep doing more videos..You rock!!
7849,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),"Thanks for the video! 

At 9:12 you mention a cheat sheet. Do you recommend any in particular? I've tried looking but quality tends to vary a lot."
7850,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),Can you make a vid of your resume so that we can learn from that
7851,How I Got My First Data Science Internship (And How You Can Land One),Thank you for sharing man

7857,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,Thankyou for such informative content! Ken Jee! 🙌❤️ I would highly appreciate it if you can review my resume since i am also aspiring to be a Data Scientist in the future 😊
7858,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,"Actually you can spell check in illustrator. I use illustrator myself btw and there is spell check.
Go to Edit > Check Spelling"
7859,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,Hi Ken. Your advices are really helpful and your work is praiseworthy. Just wondering if you could make a video on how to write a cover letter..Thanks..
7860,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,"Ok, I see your real background is in Economics, and then you've moved to Data Science with a master degree, interesting... I'm a chemical engineer finishing my PhD in process control engineering this year, currently thinking about DS... thanks for your videos man"
7861,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,"You’re a LEGEND Ken!! I only discovered your channel today and I am HOOKED! I started learning to code (in python) 2 weeks ago and am starting my first k-means clustering project with a dataset about penguins today!! Thanks to your videos (and introducing me to Kaggle), I’m feeling so much less terrified!! Keep up the amazing content - I feel so motivated thanks to you!! 👏👏👏👏"
7862,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,"Helpful Tip for Adobe Illustrator (CS6 version is what I use but will still have it in other versions): They do have spell check.  You just click on the top menu bar ""Edit > Check Spelling"" or Ctrl+I for the shortcut.  Coming from an art background, I would still advise giving Adobe Illustrator another shot.  It takes a bit getting used to but you will always have more control with programs like this that are meant for better, professional design.  Great videos, love the content."
7863,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,"Your videos are so informative! You brought up a lot of good points and it was nice to see Dos as well as Don'ts. I haven't watched many of your videos yet, but I am interested in your thoughts about how one gains ""domain knowledge"" as I have noticed it is not discussed often in online materials (but it is often mentioned in my MS data science program). If you already have a video about this, I will make sure to search further!

When I started my program, I was sure I wanted to work in marketing research (I have a BBA), but now I'm distracted by all of the shiny new concepts I can learn in school. Now, I'm considering a second master's and not sure if I should do computer science, software engineering or marketing research. Decisions, decisions, but 5 AM probably isn't the best time to be making life decisions.... 😂"
7864,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,"Cool video , but why three clocks?"
7865,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,"Hi Ken! Thanks for this amazing video! Can I ask you where you did your resume? I mean which program or web site you can recommend and why? I know you mentioned MS Word, but it very poor on design."
7866,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,"Hey Ken, super insightful video! I understand you should always show results in your work experiences, but how would you do that for data analytics/BI experiences e.g. designed dashboards, built charts, prepared reports, cleaned up data, ran ad-hoc data analysis, etc. 
I have listed SQL (BigQuery) and working git,python and tableau knowledge in my skills section, currently facing problems in quantifying achievements, thanks in advance!"
7867,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,"Hi Ken, i have strong fundamentals on programming, and I can easily learn math , but i don´t know anything related to neither business things nor economics topics... is this mandatory to become a data scientist? And if so, do you know where can i learn it?"
7868,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,Ken - you've made a great niche that fills a big need. Thanks for your support of the emerging data science community.
7869,Critiquing MY OWN Data Science Resume,"hey man, i know basic/intermediate programming in R/Pyhton so that i can introduce algorithms from libraries- like lm() in R-Studio. Right now i think the next best step would be to improve my programming skills since i study econometrics/statistics for the theoretical basis. What would be the best way to do that?  It would also be interesting to know if you as a full Data Scientist use libraries or if you just program the algorithms for yourself. Thanks in advance for an answer :)"

7967,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),Why did so many ppl dislike this? Going through projects step by step pointing out the nuance is helping me A LOT
7968,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),"Wooow- just diving into this video but what a great series idea. (Endless content created by others, who are willing participants) 

the coding virus has spread and isn’t stopping— as more people dive in; videos in this series and your channel by extension, will explode

All of this is miles above my head but I’m slowly getting it"
7969,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),"Hi @Ken Jee, thank you so much for your videos, it helps me a lot to navigate what I need to do to improve my portfolio. 
Would you mind giving me a little bit more information about this? I generally put my analysis writing on my Medium.com and code on Github. Then I connected the two together because I got those Medium.com articles that got featured on TowardsDataScience. Plus, Medium.com generally provides a much better layout for my project analysis. Do you think that approach is much better compared to just publish the analysis on Github?
Looking to hearing from you soon"

7976,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),"Hi Ken! Im currently working on my first regression analysis (first concrete data science project really), but I’m being pretty thorough. Would you like to review it? It’s an assessment for my stats class, but most of what I do is not required since we have more concrete data science classes next year. It is due in Sunday, so if you are interested I can provide it for you. Just keep in mind it’s a first for me :)"
7977,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),"Awesome, as always! I found this one particularly interesting, because it was well documented and went rather in depth. It shows that you can always do something to spice up your projects. On a different note, how many hours do you actually work to create one video? It is really incredible how you've kept up with consistent uploads for over a year and I am just curious about how much time this takes for you."
7978,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),"Thanks ken:) your videos are just great, l'm planning to become a data analytic, any recommendations for specific channels and courses please ,, cause I just feel I'm lost."

7981,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),"Hey Ken i got an idea for a project to work on my own (i posted it on the comment section of the video prior to that one, but just in case you only check comments of your most recent video), can i send an elaborated version of my idea via email so you can have a quick look and give me a little bit of insight ?
Thanks"
7982,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),"Loved the part where you mentioned how him including small personal details on his GitHub such as how he likes Chess can have such an influential factor on people looking at his profile! 
Will definitely reference this video again in the future :)"

I’m going to be getting my masters in business analytics starting in the fall and am trying to work on some projects this summer to get some more experience. My goal is to work as a data analyst for a couple of years and then transition into data science. Your channel is very informative for understanding this field and how to leverage Kaggle and github because my current experience level is just MIS/analytics undergrad and internships. It’s really helpful to hear about these topics from someone with experience that isn’t a professor. Keep up the great work!"
7989,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),Ken Jee your content is awesome! I feel you really did a great job covering some of the important aspects. I worked as a Senior Data Scientist for some time and what really helped me get a lot of interviews was my research experience in ML  and DS.
7990,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),"Hi Ken, can you talk about how to manage and overcome conflicts when working with a team of programmers? It would be very helpful to get your input on this topic. Thanks!"

7996,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),"Liking this Review series!  Absolutely agree with you at 14:38 that tree-based methods may be useful for giving feature importance but the lack of direction in which the features influences the model render it less useful than that of linear model's regression coefficients. Recently, I have been experimenting with the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library (https://github.com/slundberg/shap) and it is filling this need by also giving the direction at which the feature influences the base values along with the magnitude as in linear models, and the great thing is that it works on nearly all ML algorithms too (tree-based included)."
7997,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),I'm tying to get better at explaining and documenting my work so this is a great example for future reference! Thank you for sharing it!

8018,My First Data Science Contracting Side-Gig (How I Did It),"so after i graduated in civil eng. i did some worked hated it so had to quit tryna find my self i came across data science its soemthing if i put in effort i can truly be great but i have been studying since 8-9 months i havent achieved the mastery people online tell so its really getting frustating for me because idk maybe i get too overwhelmed from the codes i see and i am like how i dont know this basic code i can understand the methods involved but i dont feel confident enough for a job but i need atleast an intern job or something because i just acnt sit at home seeing my life passing by ,i know its much i had to let it out somewhere 
sharing experience and advice would be helpful"
8019,My First Data Science Contracting Side-Gig (How I Did It),"Now you really seem confident in this video!

It's just incredible how much you and your channel has evolved in such a relatively short period of time! Very inspirational!"
8020,My First Data Science Contracting Side-Gig (How I Did It),"Hi Ken, I know it is not related to the video but I got a question, I was planning to start a Data Science club at my high school and what suggestions do you have for projects and stuff like that to do at the club that are friendly for high school students... Thank You Ken!"
8021,My First Data Science Contracting Side-Gig (How I Did It),"Hey Ken your doing a fabulous job! Your videos help me a lot. Thank you mate .
I wanted to ask you how do you manage time? Because in this field you gotta put in hours and I'm that kind of guy who like to relax on weekends after a hard week. I mean how do you do it? I mean being on YouTube and learning new everyday and working your job? Can you please share some insights.You also reply try to reply to almost every comments which is one of the reason  I love your channel . Thankyou Ken . Love Dinesh"

8036,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,I wrote my bachelors thesis about a programm I wrote in R. I like it :)
8037,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"I have a scholarship that will fund most of an MSBA, but they use R for the whole program and no Python. I’d prefer Python, but do you think there’s any value in learning R first? I have no programming background"
8038,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,Focus on one at the the beginning then move to another one to take the advantage of the two nice software
8039,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,I think R is definitely something worth to learn because if it isn't Google would not choose it to include it in Data Analytics specialization instead of Python.
8040,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"Im more to business focus DS so I'm using python as my primary tool. I will use R when I am working on a relevant domain for it. Pretty much depends on the domain of the project I am working on. For business domain, Python is sufficient for me at least. Cheers."
8041,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"why do we want to program for data science. We need to make that clear. Data Science and ML is all about finding patterns and predicting results. Once you get the results then use anything to make that result work. I'm really fed up of hearing R is not flexible, R is not programmer friendly. But does it get the job done, yes, then where's the argument. This trend started when programmers got to believe they can do ML and DS"
8042,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"Hi Sir, I am not a programmer 
I am a Statistics Graduate Student Pursuing PG in Advances Statistics
What should I learn for Data analytics or statistical modelling R  or Python ?"
8043,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"Actually, I learned R somewhat during my college days because it was in my syllabus. It was good but yes as medical research is not relevant for me right now then I am learning python these days... 
I think R may be useful these days as there many predictions and research is on COVID."
8044,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"I’m new, but I personally really like R"
8045,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"For someone who tries to learn a programming language to specifically run statistical analysis (GLM, regression, ANOVA, FA, HLM, SEM...), R is definitely the one to go with."
8046,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"I already kinda know beginner/intermediate R due to university (math) but from all the videos information I get, everyone suggests python so I want to learn python... But my selected masters ALSO does things in R(msc stats and data science) so fuck my life I guess I'll have to Learn python after R the way things are going 😂😂"
8047,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"Hi. Thanks for your review, but it seems like unfair to compare Apple 🍎 to orange . Where python is general language with general purpose , unlike R which is a niche programming language otherwise a statistical mathematical language. R is specific that what makes it better than any other language while dealing with analysis. Also R is faster while dealing with large data,  the more the data is big the more is faster. Unlike python which get slower with larger data.

Also the number of contributions and packages is far bigger than python if we compare them in the niche of data science statistics etc..

Visualisation same things while R is the market standard for official productions, I think there is #rstats on Twitter where folks publish there artistic visualisations, also I guess the (TidyTuesday) contest where community provides weekly data for challenges and contributions. 

Machine learning,  users can use R as interface to Tensorflow/keras and pytoch and more, also, a tones of ml packages comes a long to perform complex models.

If you are a developer dealing sometimes with data I suggest you to stay with python . Otherwise data analysts and researchers should pick-up R and stick to it. 

Every language is important,  know what you need to achieve first.  Than choose what is most comprehensive language that will fulfill  ur need and don't rush yourself much."
8048,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"#21: I totally agree it's better to start with #Python, is more flexible, easy to learn, with more examples and people involved. And if it's required R, as all programming languages are easy to transfer. #66daysofdata"
8049,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,👍👍👍👍👍
8050,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"Should you learn R? No, because you already know it."
8051,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,How about SAS for data analysis?
8052,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,I use R on my work for almost 2yrs. And wondering if it is worth it to sticking on R or transition completely to python. My work is mostly for data engineering and automation.
8053,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,Did he say “python was easier to manipulate data than R”...  this guy does not really know R
8054,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,Thank you for your insight!  very helpful!
8055,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"To be honest, a person who can wield two swords is the one who is the most deadly. I like to leverage both in my workflow. R gives me beautiful visualizations and rapid fast data cleaning with tidyverse packages, and I can use python for fitting machine learning models with sklearn and dimensionality reduction, as well as neural networks. Both have their benefits and I don’t think one should use just one vs the other."
8056,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"I like the way Ken Lee is replying to every comment.

 Your effort will  always be appreciated"
8057,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"want to develop a fashion designing bot i.e a software that can generate new apparels on giving instructions by a non programmer designer eg colour combo, age, gender, season etc
So which language should I choose R or Python"
8058,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"How about a movement the other way around, from R to Python? or at least, how to start obtaining some fluency in python when you have started with learning R? 
thanks."
8059,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"I prefer using both,sometimes its just exiciting if you have tools that Can close the disadvantages of another tools.I used R for analyzing data and it's easy to do many statistical testing than python, in my opinion,but remember you also need to know SQL and hadoop for this data science"
8060,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"thanks for the advice, i`ll start learning python right now. the quality of the video would be 3xbetter (at least for me) if you look right to the camera when speaking. idk maybe im weird but i feel it makes a big difference.  thanks again :)"
8061,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"I first learned python when I started programming and switched to R because that's the language my DS course was taught on. However, it would be hard for me to go back to python, I'm just way too used to Rstudio's interface. I don't know if there's an IDE that would let you have the same 4 panel layout on python"
8062,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"In general, python and R are very similar in my opinion."
8063,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"yes, python is better in many ways, espetially for programming issues, but for data wrangling (dplyr etc.), data analisys, visualisation (ggplot) and modelling, there is nothing what comes close to tidyverse. I tried to transition to python in the academia, and it was just painful. cheers"
8064,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"hi Ken if i already use R should
 I learn python or continue with R"
8065,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,"Very informative, thank you !"
8066,Should You Learn R for Data Science?,Good title
8067,5 Unusual Data Science Projects that Will Land You a Job,I believe one thing that makes project strange if you think about problem you are facing in day to day life and try build project around it. In that way your project will be strange enough to catch a reader attention.
8068,5 Unusual Data Science Projects that Will Land You a Job,Let's build a project on Papaya and Ken will definitely hire you. 😂
8069,5 Unusual Data Science Projects that Will Land You a Job,"Hey Ken. What would the best approach be if I already have a project but am just getting started with Python programming? 
On conversing with a data scientist one time, I was told it was a deep learning problem. I am confused if I should learn what's necessary for this project or approach it like everyone else?"
8070,5 Unusual Data Science Projects that Will Land You a Job,Does the building a web app require another language besides python?

8073,5 Unusual Data Science Projects that Will Land You a Job,"I like the last project ideas. :) It's nice how you start from scrapping and data analysis and end with AI ;)

What did you do for the glassdoor project (data scraping wise) if you don't mind me asking? If I understand things correctly, if the robots.txt forbids you from scraping them, you use their API and all is cool? 

How is it with using youtube data for data science projects? I'm not talking about downloading videos - I'm interested in comments, video titles and thumbnails. Intuitively it should be ok to use those... 

Edit: I should watch the videos of the projects you reviewed for inspiration."
8074,5 Unusual Data Science Projects that Will Land You a Job,"Hi Ken, love your videos. Got a question for web scrapping tho. Maybe I'm missing it, but what should I be looking out for in the robots.txt about scraping? I pulled up the glassdoor one on my own, but not sure which line says to not scrape. Maybe I'm missing it or don't really know what to look for."
8075,5 Unusual Data Science Projects that Will Land You a Job,What is the best tool for webscraping

8085,5 Unusual Data Science Projects that Will Land You a Job,Great video! You should have mentioned RShiny/Shiny apps in your second (third?) bullet point though! But I'm heavily partial/biased towards R haha. Great vid. I like the idea of doing a project involving web scraping. The one thing that can be frustrating about being in grad school for stats is all of our data sets are already cleaned for us. We just get it and most of the time it's all good to go so we can just worry about doing whatever statistics we need to do on it. Scraping data sounds like a good way to get some nice raw data that would require some cleaning and then running some cool analytics on after some EDA. Great content.
8086,5 Unusual Data Science Projects that Will Land You a Job,Pivoting my career interests to data science has recently sparked an idea for a startup I might want to pursue one day in the near future 🤐

8239,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),"Hey Ken! Great introductory video! Thanks :) i have been doing small projects involving blockchain. For example, I scrape blockchain data but i do it using beautifulsoup and selenium. There are APIs but most are not well documented and are not free. When you said “new tools” to work with blockchain data, what do you mean? Also, if you are looking for projects, i would love to brainstorm with you and come up with ideas. I am already working on one and would be great to discuss it with you :)"
8240,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),"Hey Ken! I would love to hear opinion from you regarding your graduate program at DePaul. Do you think it is a good program for someone without formal CS background? I studied Quantitative Economics as undergrad without programming experience, except statistical programs like eViews, Stata and SPSS. I am currently doing internship at Fortune 200 company as Data Analyst where I will craft my Data Modelling, Analysis and Visualization skills using ( Power) Excel, PowerBI, SQL, Python Spark, matplotlib, pandas etc."

8254,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),"Great video. Interesting that we sort of agree on the whole thing. Ive been stressing this for a while. The true way to make money in AI (especially in the Web 3 context) is through Data. People often think of big models and fancy architectures in Machine Learning, but that's not the major component"
8255,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),So its already Jan 17. Am I too late to start my #66DaysofData?
8256,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),"Loved your analysis of web 3, Ken! I've also recently researched a bit about blockchain for my CS study. Totally agreed, a lot of loose ends on the web 3 discussion that still needs to be solved before it can become mainstream."
8257,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),Nice perspective. As a computational chemist applying ML methods I'm always highly suspicious about people being too excited about any new methodology. And even though I am a retail investor in crypto projects I just can't imagine most narratives to come true.
8258,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),Awesome explanation Ken!!
8259,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),All Ken's videos during the past year had perfect audio quality .. I think this is just some kind of bug or unexpected thing during editing or upload .. The video is very interesting though so I hope everyone can overlook this one time issue and focus on the topic 🌻
8260,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),As a data librarian web 3 will be instrumental in making data resources more accessible.

8262,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),So should I expect a ken and Avery colab? 👀👀
8263,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),"What I am confused on Data Science and AI with the development of web 3 is, if the data are publicly available- I guess (more like believe) the owner of the data would be kept anonymous. Although there is plenty of data out in the web, how would the business make strategies to reach to their audiences/customers? Wouldn't it be like television/radio/newspaper ads? 
Also, how would the services reach to their probable new customers/audiences? Basically how would AI work for recommendation and how would business collect data to grow their business? 
I don't think the recommendation system would be like throwing anything to the public what they want people to see (not what people want to see.). Facebook and Youtube are not hurt."
8264,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),Bad audio quality
8265,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),"I think video has a audio issue. 
But I watched completely. 
Looking forward to read more about web3"
8266,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),Bro your voice has a problem
8267,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),I believe irrespective of your field exploring blockchain is must to explore topic in current times.
8268,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),"Secret web 3 project with?!? What!!!!! That sounds exciting. But seriously, every transaction being publicly available is a pretty cool idea, but also kinda scary. Think about your credit card bill being public. 😩"
8269,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),I was eagerly waiting for your opinion on this topic.
8270,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),Can you please share how to get started a career in web3 ?
8271,Should You Be Excited About Web 3? (As a Data Scientist),"Thanks for watching everyone! New web 3 project is going to be an analysis of some web 3 data! What type of web 3 data would you be interested in seeing us analyze? Also, I apologize for the audio poorer audio quality on this one. Using a new camera and I guess I didn't tune it right!"
8272,How To Learn Programming for Data Science [3 Steps],"Yes, it is such a big downer to know statistics but to don´t be able to do a fing simple thing because absolutely nothing works and you can take 3 hours surfing from one topic to another on stackoverflow because you can´t even ch ange the color of a table. I miss Spss so much"
8273,How To Learn Programming for Data Science [3 Steps],"Hi Ken, I'm currently doing a structural biology PhD. The only experience with python/programming I have is through two things: 1) undergrad research where I was doing in silico drug screening against to protein homologs via programs such autodock followed by molecular dynamics. I had to write a few basic python scripts that made the program I was using (YASARA) run and export these simulations over about 20K small molecules per homolog. Things YASARA didn't have built in. That was 4+ years ago (took a job as a technician in a structural biology lab for about 3 years). Finally got into a PhD program but want to move into the computational side (though not entirely giving up wet-lab/experimental structure determination. I'm currently doing my lab rotations and have become more interested in methods. So for cryo-EM and crystallography using computers to help aid in determining structure, which requires ML/DL. On top of that I'm still interested in molecular dynamics of protein-ligan interactions, etc. Which might not be as influenced by data science. Lastly, I had a short course (about half a semester) that introduced R for bio/strucbio data analysis and plotting.

I've been reading a lot of theory (as that's what most professors I'm interested in working with/rotating through seem publish) but still have and am working on my python programming.

Any suggestions for this path? How does one balance graduate school with learning a new skill? The PhD route takes up so much time, how does one learn programming to slightly change projectory within their first year of grad school (to be of interest to comp bio/phys PIs but also so that one has enough experience so that they're not embarrassed or feel like they're holding the research back)?

That was long winded, but thanks!"

8302,How To Learn Programming for Data Science [3 Steps],I am not a data scientist or interested in it but i do a bit of data analysis in my field of learning and development. I primarily use R and I would encourage people not to shy away from R. It's different from pythion because it is a domain specific language while python is a general purpose language. R has some great packages such as the Tidyverse which allows very easy exploration of data. Also you can use R and Python together.

8341,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,ah I thought you were gonna say you never did it :x
8342,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,First project can never be a perfect piece. The most important thing is to take start rather than thinking about the level of outcomes.
8343,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,I'm not a data analyst or anything but just the idea of having an automated judge was enough to make me watch the whole thing haha
8344,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,"Hi Ken. I am a undergrad student and I am deeply interested in Data science. In final year, should I do thesis or do project on data science?
ThanksInAdvance"
8345,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,"Such useful insights for beginners! 
Thanks, Ken🙌"
8346,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,"Lol, for my research project in grad school I wrote some models based off of LSA, GloVe, and Word2Vec and the best accuracy I got was 16% from w2v. My LSA model was scoring at 4% lmao. it was hilariously bad. It really was humorous to me just how bad they were performing. I was able to (over some grueling months) get my W2V model up to 65% accuracy which for the task at hand, I still consider to be quite good honestly."
8347,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,"Thank you so much for your great content, Ken! I enjoy your channel so much. I'm kind of an outlier here. LOL I did a masters in statistics in the 80's and then was a statistical consultant for agricultural projects using SAS for several years. After a 35-year hiatus from formal data analysis (but not from thinking data and teaching math) I came back last year to complete a data science certification to try to get up to speed in the data world. Wow! What a challenge!

I did one big project for my certification, but I want to do several more for my own benefit and for my portfolio before I start looking for contracts. Your videos give me lots of possibilities. I just really enjoy how you present ideas. Thank you again."
8348,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,Great video Ken! Can definitely relate to your thumbnail when I was working on my first project lol 😂
8349,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,"Hey Ken, I've been enjoying your videos! Great channel you have by the way. I'm currently a junior in college, pursuing a degree in mathematics and I have a interest in the data science field. I've taken a couple of programming classes like intro to computer science and predicative analytics and I still plan to learn more on my own free time. Will employers still prefer a computer science major over a math major? What are your thoughts?"
8350,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,Failures and bad experiences are what I need to hear as a junior. Because that's what happens to me mostly and everyone talks about good things happened to them which is unreal.
8351,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,HE'S BACK!! Awesome vid Ken!
8352,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,"🤔""If you knew then what you know now"" (or even recreate the same project now) could you do a better job or is predicting the judging on a match just a 50% success? Also, did your model take into consideration the judges themselves as (in)consistent variables?

Everyone's first attempts at something don't look good as subsequent efforts, particularly after years of experience. Do you apply how you've ""failed"" (even today) to improving your skills or possibly utilize the failure data as part of your model(s)?"
8353,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,"Great insights.
Not working on any project but currently competing on my first ever kaggle competition. Learning alot on daily basis."
8354,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,Glad to see you after long time..!
8355,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,"Is most code for almost all projects just copied from one source or another, and we just change the parameter values  ,like epochs, or batch_size? Or is there something else, regarding making projects?"
8356,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,He is back 🔥🔥
8357,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,"Thanks Ken! I'm just starting my first data project for grad school and it's still in the data collection phase. I have a team of four undergrads working for me so right now I'm still trying to figure out what it is I'll want to analyze and present to the grant makers but we have some time to figure that part out.

Do you have any advice for the pre-planning phase of research? I feel more comfortable in my coding than I do in project management but in this case, it's all part of the same project."
8358,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,"But talkin ✨g about something purely my idea .
I think I had problem with defining the problem statement and looking for right data . I just use to see the topic I want to work on and not on the problem statement. And secondly also I use to just take data if it's related to the topic and not to the problem statement biggest mistake . Took me a lot of time to get out of this mindset"
8359,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,"Thank you so much for sharing, Ken."
8360,The TRUTH About My First Data Science Project,"I love the MMA data set. Also, MMA math never works."

8373,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,Api is everywhere. And Api economy is getting boom day by day
8374,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,Thank you bro  about each word you talked it
8375,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,Hey Ken! Any suggestions regarding a course related to API or data engineering stuff? Thank you!
8376,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,Fire explanation!!
8377,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,What should I choose between B.tech Cse with specialization in ai/ml engineering and B.tech Cse with specialization in data science?
8378,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,"If I had a dollar for every time I googled about API's... 








prolly just have like 50 dollars by now."
8379,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,"Your 5min videos are perfect for my pomodoro breaks.
They help me staying motivated on my journey to learn data science and become a data scientist ! 💪

Keep up the good work ! 👍"
8380,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,You mean that API does not stand for Automatic Pizza Ingredients? 😔
8381,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,"Great video! But completely unrelated, at my college I have a choice to get either a BA or BS in data science. Do you think employers care if I have one or the other? I’ve been looking around online, but I feel like someone who is actually in the field would have the best idea."
8382,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,Yess I always wanted to start with APIs uwu
8383,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,"WOAH no glasses!!

Haha but It's really amazing to see how much better your videos have gotten in the past year!  Loving the content Ken! 

#Roadto200K"
8384,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,"@Ken, I would guess APIs will be needed for any software related profession going forward
That said, what's the deal with papayas 😏?
And could you consider a walkthrough of creating an API from a data science model as one of your future YouTube videos? Please consider adding it to your (probably already huge) backlog / list 😅"
8385,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,Awesome explanation with some great practical examples
8386,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,"Your thumbnail is trash for a mobile viewers, which means not appealing to most of YouTube users. 

Note: Small font, and hard to understand thumbnail."
8387,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,"One thing I LOVE about your videos is you provide notes in the description so viewers don't have to scramble to copy down information spoken to quickly or flashed on the screen for a few seconds. (This of course is second to your sense of humor. 😂🤣😂🤣 @ 0:05 ""Automatic Papaya Integration"")

One suggestion / request: would it be possible to replace LONG URLs with tiny URLs? 
Cutting-n-pasting the description notes often leads to long URLs cut off with "". . ."" at the end instead of the full URL text. The only choice is to manually go to each site and copy the full URL for later reference."
8388,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,"Some topics for video are,
1. How will Automation affect IT jobs?
2. Where do you see data science after next 10 years?"

8394,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,"Hey, Nice explanation. 
Can you make a  video of #shorts about statistics concepts."
8395,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,"Notes from the video
•API : Application programming interface
•API is basically messenger between two applicants. It recieves a request from the user and we get the response
•It is important for data scientist's because of :-
a) best way to access data. Many websites gives access to data through API
b) reliable and consistent
c) one of the best ways to make your model useful is to turn it into an API
d) saves us time through reusability (leveraging pre built models) 
•How to use an API? 
Find a documentation for an API of your interest and send a request to API
•How to make API? 
Create a basic web server that takes requests and returns responses"
8396,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,"Hi Ken Jee
can you add subtitle for this video?"
8397,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,Maybe a dedicated video on freelancing as a data scientist?
8398,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,It is very important but still a hard concept to grasp 💯🙌
8399,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,Great video Ken ! API creation is an area that I should look into soon. Also you look great with or without glasses :)
8400,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,Of course. API stands for AUTOMATIC PAPAYA INTEGRATION
8401,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,Good one 👍.. thanks for sharing..
8402,Why are APIs Important for Data Science?,"Such a timely video. 

Is there a tree of some sort that outlines the branches of learning you should take for a data science job?"

8448,What is the Future of my Comment Leaderboard Project?,"Hey Ken! I
 have been learning data science for the last year. and I have one problem which I often face and can't find the answer to. which learning an algorithm, we get the logic behind it. we learn the intuition behind the algorithm. but while doing a project, and actually applying those algorithms, we see a lot of parameters, literally 20-50 parameters. and I personally don't get the intuition behind all those parameters. looking at those parameters makes it more complex. when I search on the internet, it says that ""usually we use this value for this parameters "". but can't find the reason. Also, while learning deep learning, it's too difficult to find an answer to my doubt. I hope you got what my problem is... let me know your view on it. 
Also, I love your content. :D"

8476,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,Bayesian Learning will be very important. The BBN ability to operate probabilistically and work with incomplete evidence is quite powerful. It can also allow for interesting dataset quality/Imputation checks. I don't know why more people don't talk about this
8477,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,Found it. your great content on ML-Ops. Thanks
8478,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,"Hii Ken,

I am also trying to switch career to data science field. Just had one question. How much programming is required?? Are data structures like trees and their algorithms also important?"
8479,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,"Thanks for sharing. It seems like one of those areas which you don't really get the hang of unless you're in the industry, simply because companies have that infrastructure built."

Was fairly confused on it at first but this video definitely helped!"
8483,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,"Hi Ken,
I am planning to change Career to be a Data Scientist 
Although I started the Google Analytics professional certification and I plan to then do a course in Python for Data science after. I am realising it may not be the right step to take and maybe a water of time 
Do you think it may be useful and I should complete the course or do I just dive into a Data science course instead."
8484,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,As usual excellent content.
8485,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,Great and concise video Ken on MLop! Is that a Papaya T-shirt? At first thought the black circles were scattered data points but the hint at 5:36 suggested they’re black seeds of the Papaya?
8486,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,That shirt though
8487,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,"Great video, Ken! Does only big companies have ML Ops department/team?"
8488,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,Loving the increased production quality in your videos lately! I've always been a bit unsure what ML Ops means but your explanation makes sense. Curious to know if you're trying to implement it yourself?
8489,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,"Hi uncle Ken, Great video, thanks for sharing this.... Can you do a video of you doing a full kaggle project ( if you want to XD ) it will be really cool 

Stay Hard"

8492,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,"Thanks for the video ! 
I understand the importance of MLOps as a concept, but I don't understand why it has become a job.

I feel like MLOps principles should be carried out by data scientists that understand business and project managers that understand data science ; there is no need for a separate position."
8493,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,"Ml ops was something that I didn't  understand but now I do 💯. I know what video to send someone if you want to know meaning of Mlops or devops.
Thank you Ken!!!!"
8494,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,Commenting for the algorithm. Keep it up!
8495,ML Ops: What is it REALLY?,"I am scared of Docker :3 Should probably work more on it starting in this area. Also does this mean that pineapple is your second favourite fruit haha ? 
Oh and btw I graduated from my Master's today 😁😀"

8543,What is Sports Analytics Really?,"#64: I never had the chance to have time on Fridays or Saturdays for 66 Days of Data, today was my lucky day!
I do like the one that gives insights to make decisions or help the athletes to improve performance.
In the past was difficult to keep track of how an athlete was responding to the training loads, how was sleeping, how was recovering with all the variables that differ from gender to position in the game (or sport). 
It's fascinating to see how some products and the Data Science applied have helped organizations, coaches, and athletes to find the invisible reasons for bad performance or injury :) 
On that, I think that the psychological component it's not being evaluated, which could be a great area to focus too!

8605,Avoid These Data Science Resume Mistakes!,"Hi Ken, I was hoping to get your advice on something. Well I'm currently getting my Masters in Engineering Management with a Specilization in Analytics. I beleive that was the best path for me to take since I want to start out as a Data Scientist and eventually scale over to Product Management. This program basically teaches me both skills. However, I've noticed that there are a lot of MS CS and MS DS majors who apply for these majors. Do you think I should change my major to match those or do you think I should remain in the track that I am. I still believe once I am done with the program, I'll have the same skillset as the other majors, I just don't want to get screened out of getting a chance to be interviewed."
8606,Avoid These Data Science Resume Mistakes!,Really helpful insights Ken
8607,Avoid These Data Science Resume Mistakes!,"Thanks Ken.  I really like the idea of tip 3, on focusing on the outcome not the algorithms.  I'm guilty of spending all my energy on trying to show off a complex algorithm rather than why I'm doing the project in the first place....i.e. what will it help answer/solve and then how to convey that answer.  I'm going to go back and update a few recent projects."
8608,Avoid These Data Science Resume Mistakes!,"Hi ken, I have only one internship related to Data science, but I also worked in a Newsagent, a hostel, and I taught English as a voluntary project. Do you think I should mention them as well ? Or just compensate my lack of experience with more projects and mention that one internship ? Thank you for your time. I really respect you for answering most if not all of the comments on your videos."

8613,Avoid These Data Science Resume Mistakes!,"Hey Ken, I have become a recent follower of yours. Thanks for all the info you have been giving on DS, trying to keep all of that in mind while working. 
I have recently done some basic DS projects on Kaggle and I don't think the end result I have gotten out of them are good enough, so should I upload them on github inspite of the not-so-good results or should I first focus on improving them and then upload it?

Thanks in advance!"

8615,Avoid These Data Science Resume Mistakes!,"I'm migrating from a software career to data science. I have a few data science projects in my portfolio. But still at least a 90% of my projects are pure technical software projects. Is it a good idea to list these in my portfolio. Because if not, I'll be presenting a resume with 5 years of software expeirience with no actual portfolio for that part of my life. Does it do any good. Or bad. Can you give your thoughts.?"

8627,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 3 (Advanced Graphs & Gender Imbalance Analysis),"damn this is boring...no offense mate, I'm sure the learning is great, but I was interested in whta data scientists do, as I'm a just finish law degree and will probably go onto IP/ICT Law masters here in the UK, so was thinking if I could somehow mix it with data and become a data protection solicitor - mostly about GDPR and then the IP with it so like trademarks, copyrights, designs...but now seeing how boring data science is (even for a coder like myself), I wouldn't enjoy doing this. Prolly will switch back to international commercial law xD"
8628,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 3 (Advanced Graphs & Gender Imbalance Analysis),"This series is gold. Learned a lot ! Thank you for the effort. Hope you gain some new followers. This is what makes you stand out. 
Please, keep on doing these kaggle series. I think this is way more helpful than simple tutorials of how svm works or why you should normalization yout data :). To see the analysis in a real scenario helps for sure."

8631,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 3 (Advanced Graphs & Gender Imbalance Analysis),"I'm surprised that Data Scientists don't recommend SQL, while it's true that you need an analytic like the ones provided by Python or R, SQL is simple and almost as important. 
PS: I didn't want to make a new comment, but I was afraid this opinion would get overlooked if I just edited the old one."

8640,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 3 (Advanced Graphs & Gender Imbalance Analysis),"Great video Ken! Nice and thorough analysis. 😆Towards the end of the video, the imbalanced gender classes is roughly 80/20, if we were to convert this to a classification model, would be interesting to apply undersampling or oversampling to create a balanced model that may potentially be used for model interpretation."
8641,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 3 (Advanced Graphs & Gender Imbalance Analysis),How come you are using linear models but did not scale the data? Or did I miss that? Also this gave me a ton of ideas. One would be definitely to do a feature selection after one hot encoding and see if the explained variance improves?
8642,Kaggle Project From Scratch - Part 3 (Advanced Graphs & Gender Imbalance Analysis),been following this series since part 1 and i can safely say i have an idea of how to build and learn from kaggle projects

Suggestion for a future video - ""Data Science and the Coronavirus"""
8671,The 5 Stages of Learning Data Science,"As always, great video!


One idea I haven't heard of before is focusing on one project and learning only the specific skills necessary for that project. Everyone's experienced the overwhelm when it comes to beginning the Data Science / ML / DL journey, and we're usually hit with the, ""learn all of statistics, all of programming, and all of math"" mentality that is drilled into our heads. This can be enough to scare people away, and your advice really combats this while touching on the idea of running on passion and things you enjoy by picking a personal project or use case.




It's really cool to see that you have a specific domain that you stay in for projects (sports and sports betting). My question is:


Do you stay within that domain at work?


If you do, do you suggest that we each choose a specific domain as well, and cater towards that when building a career and finding a job?
If you don't, would you agree that it's still valuable to choose a specific domain? Do you think that your experience and expertise in sports / sports betting transfers over to your current job/position?


Thanks for the video Ken!"
8672,The 5 Stages of Learning Data Science,I think that what worked for me can definitely work for you in this case. You need to be patient and consistent when learning this field. Feel free to comment any questions that you may have below!
8673,The 5 Stages of Learning Data Science,In your opinion is a statistics' degree useful to become a data scientist or is completely useless?
8674,The 5 Stages of Learning Data Science,"I’m in the second stage forsure, I hate it, it demotivated me, haven’t been working as hard because every time I get stuck I see the answer that I could never have though of with functions idek how they got, and I’m like I’ve been on this problem for an hour. It’s like macro-patience and micro-results"

I already know python I have some basic knowledge of statistic and different library used for data visualisation

nowhere is my main question of how I can train myself to professionally become a data scientist, I tried udemy courses but they were basic I want to learn things that are practically used

I did my graduation in computer science engineering so I know how to write code and all"
8684,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 3 (Student Portfolio),Bro should i learn algos first or libraries like numpy matplot ?.....🙏🙏
8685,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 3 (Student Portfolio),"Hey Ken, I'm a new subscriber. I have really enjoyed watching your videos. They're great and very informative. I'm interested in data science and  data engineering. I'm debating between get an MS Computer Science or MS Data Science from DePaul University.   Would you advise I pursue a CS or Data Science degree if I'm interested in both fields? Also, I believe that you went to DePaul for your MS. Would you recommend DePaul's MSCS or MS Data Science program? Thanks!"

8690,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 3 (Student Portfolio),"Awesome! I think you talked about a lot of points which can be found on beginner portfolios, as you have said multiple times already, documentation is really important. I notice it personally as well, once you have 90% of the project finished the last 10% can sometimes be the most tedious, even though they are really important.


I just noticed that your channel pretty much blew up after the last video and I want to congratulate you on that! :D
I was definitely sure that you would hit the 10k milestone this year but this was really a good amount quicker than I expected, so congrats to you, that was definitely well deserved!"
8691,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 3 (Student Portfolio),"I came across your channel recently you explained the things very well 🌟🌟!! what tips would you give me as i am intrested in data science and beginner in this field .
I'll be waiting for your response."
8692,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 3 (Student Portfolio),"nice vid man, was very helpful :) I have a question: is it better, when i have one repository for projects, which are separated in different folders or for every project i have to make own repository? I'm just beginner in github"
8693,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 3 (Student Portfolio),"Hi Ken. Great video. Does it look bad to Data Science professionals if all of an applicant's projects rely on existing packages like scikit-learn, gensim, keras, etc.? Is it significantly helpful to applicants to have their own implementations of regression, random forests, naive bayes, etc.? in the same way that computer scientist students have their own implementations of sorts and stuff"
8694,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 3 (Student Portfolio),"Forgot to mention it last time, I like the new intro :)"

8711,How to Build a Website  - Building my ULTIMATE Portfolio Website,"Hello!

I am a big fan of your channel and your content helps me learn data science and ML

I am a tennis player and I was thinking on how I could apply data analytics to my game. I did some research and I found a startup called SwingVision that analyses your game using AI.

I thought that I could do something similar mixing my passion of tennis and AI. I have been doing some research but I am not aware of any tool that allows me to do something similar to that. I found some research papers but they had too much math and they were too complex to build my app from that. Are you aware of some framework or any tool that allows me to do something like that? Or do you think that I need to make new algorithms? Also, do you have any tips on how to make it a profitable Saas?

Thank you, ☺️

but also, i don't have that much data science work to display (i'm a computer science graduate with a few ds courses and projects) so maybe making it from scratch will be another way to showoff my work in itself? It's gonna be way more work so I'm wondering now which option should I do :/"

8746,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 7 (Incredible Portfolio Website),Hey Ken! Love your videos (just starting to binge). I am starting my MS in compsci with specialization in ML. Do you think that this is better or on par with the MS in data analytics from the same university? Thanks
8747,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 7 (Incredible Portfolio Website),"Thanks for these videos again Ken. I just finished making my website this weekend. One quick question: If I already have my website linked at the top of my resume, should the links to my projects go straight to its respective repository on Github or to its page on my website? Which would be best through the perspective of the hiring manager?"
8748,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 7 (Incredible Portfolio Website),"This series is really helping me a lot!

8761,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 21(The Cleanest Portfolio),The Q/A session at the last was very important. Got the answer to my own question about beginners projects. Thanks for answering that question Ken.
8762,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 21(The Cleanest Portfolio),"I totally agree with you Ken.....people really need to focus on the business results vs. techniques used or programming code. Businesses hire people to solve problems, generate sales, reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, etc. All of these things can be quantified to some degree. At a minimum, put some focus on how your project adds value to the organization. Position yourself as not just a data scientist or ML engineer, but also a value-add problem solver and business advisor. You're not in academia, you're in business."
8763,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 21(The Cleanest Portfolio),"Very good advice, I like the honest, detailed responses. Will definitely be dropping you a message when I get some more work done! - mechanical engineer"
8764,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 21(The Cleanest Portfolio),"Very instructive video, thanks !"
8765,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 21(The Cleanest Portfolio),"Thanks for this video, Ken.
Can you please walk us through the Data-domain (Data Scientist/Data Engineer/Data Analyst) recruitment process in one of ur videos?

I am doing my undergrad in Computer Sc. Engineering. The campus-recruitment at my university is more Dev-intensive, focused on coding, Data-structures and Algorithms... could you suggest me something?
Thanks. Ciao!"
8766,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 21(The Cleanest Portfolio),"hi Ken, really helpful video! Do you have any examples of how to include Github and Git into my routine? (you mentioned it at the end of the video). Do i just focus on getting my project on github or focus on how to store it and present it (if thats the case, is there a tutorial on it or would you be interested in doing some tutorials?). Or is it something totally different. 
Keep up the good work!"
8767,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 21(The Cleanest Portfolio),"A great video with so much knowledge and handy pick up things to improve for oneself. That portfolio looks smooth, any possibility you might do another video on portfolio building (feat data professor)? Would love it!"
8768,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 21(The Cleanest Portfolio),"Guys how to make ""skills enclosed in the box"" eg. Python, Keras? Check 3:49. Those look so awesome!. How to make them in LibreOffice?  Help!

Thanks, Ken Jee for the sharing another awesome video! His clean and neat CV is something I want to make on my own. Is there any paid/non-paid platform where I can make the CV in similar template?"
8769,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 21(The Cleanest Portfolio),"Hey Ken I've got a question for you related to projects and stuff you look for on a entry level data scientists resume/portfolio. I'm trying to decide what I should do for my next project and I'm unsure what will look better on my resume. 

Project A - Kaggle: 
- finish top 10% in a Kaggle competition and write a blog post outlining each step of the process and explaining my thought process of why I chose certain algorithms and my understanding of certain concepts 

Project B - solve a cool problem or answer a question with data science: 
-Pull data from an API database to get experience with SQL or collect my own data source through scraping 
-Clean the data 
-Do some advanced feature engineering with the data 
-Do some testing on different models to figure out which one performs the best 
-Create a website and put the end model into production 
-write a blog post about the project and its results   

Would love to hear your thoughts on this and if you value placing well on Kaggle more than a personal project that solves an interesting question. Cheers!"

I have a query, I have been working as a Data scientist for past 4 years in IT services firm and have delivered projects in Engineering domain(customers in manufacturing , aero, auto etc) . Even though I have some good projects(the ones I delivered for the customers)  to showcase on CV, I don't have a proper GitHub profile because I cant recreate the projects I did in GitHub  because of customer /project confidentiality.  In this case what would be your advice on building a solid GitHub profile, which datasets / project I can work on?"

could you address the gap issue if someone has couple of years gap since he/she graduated.
is this gonna be a problem in industry to get a job after 3...4 years even he/she gets  certificates from 365 data science or somewhere else.
this person's core computer science concepts are still fresh.

please give me a broad view of this issue or post a video if that's possible.
thank you :)"
8776,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 21(The Cleanest Portfolio),"Hey Ken, so I have a project where I train a neural network to determine if a piece of text is toxic or not. However, during the exploration portion of the data, racial and homophobic slurs are shown (graphs and word cloud) to emphasize that they are the most common toxic words. How would I go about saying that I do not condone these words?"

8785,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 21(The Cleanest Portfolio),Hey Ken I have two questions regarding CV. Should the projects and work experience be above educational qualifications? Would you recommend a 2-3 pages CV which is much clearer and larger in fonts or a single page CV like that of this guy?
8786,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 21(The Cleanest Portfolio),"Another awesome video in this series. Really liked your suggestion on how to present the most important key point of a project at the top, so anybody can get what its solving in the first 30 seconds to 1 mint.

8864,Business Skills for Data Science: What are they REALLY?,The ultimate Data Science goal is to solve business problems. So it goes without saying that business skills are so important!
8865,Business Skills for Data Science: What are they REALLY?,At the end of the day: Relationships are ALWAYS more important than product knowledge.
8866,Business Skills for Data Science: What are they REALLY?,Fully agree it's crucial to learn how the business makes money and learn how to clearly articulate how what you want to do will help the company make more of it. :D
8867,Business Skills for Data Science: What are they REALLY?,KEN is the BEST 🚀
8868,Business Skills for Data Science: What are they REALLY?,Ken I have a really important question. Are Data Structures and Algorithms important for Machine Learning?
8869,Business Skills for Data Science: What are they REALLY?,Really nicely explained! Thanks for the video. 🙌
8870,Business Skills for Data Science: What are they REALLY?,"How to talk to different people? If someone is good in this skill things can get more easier. I think, Communication is an art as it's the first step... I myself find how can I make more improvements to my communication skills while working in industry."
8871,Business Skills for Data Science: What are they REALLY?,"Communication, man. It is very underestimated. Most of the time, we can achieve much more if we collaborate with others. On the other hand, it requires one to have strong communication skills to manage such a collaborative organization. Unfortunately, people opt out collaborating because they fail to communicate. I am not talking about just talking to each other. I am talking about ""understanding each other"" and willing to solve problems together. 2 years ago, before my PhD oral exam, one wise professor in my PhD committee told me to relax and enjoy the process because no PhD student can be smarter than 5 professors testing you. That was a great advice, and it is very true that we are stronger together IF we can communicate to be a coherent group. 

With that said, I am wondering if there is a video about different ""data"" related roles. I am looking for internships. There are different roles, such as data engineer, data scientist, data analyst, machine learning engineer, AI engineer, etc... I have a broad idea how they differentiate, but I would like to learn more about these roles and their requirements. I quickly skimmed your videos, Ken, but couldn't find a video about it. I mean a video including all these roles, not just comparing data analyst and data scientist. If there is one, can you point me it? If not, it would be great to see a video about that.

You are doing great work popularizing the field and making data science accessible to more people, Ken.

Thank you! =)"
8872,Business Skills for Data Science: What are they REALLY?,Great video Ken! Completely agree with the points you raised - these are so underrated!
8873,Business Skills for Data Science: What are they REALLY?,Ask open-ended questions and follow-up with questions based on their responses.
8874,Business Skills for Data Science: What are they REALLY?,Thanks for the awesome video! Please make a video on how to talk to different audiences! It will be helpful to us (and you will earn a lot of loyal subscribers ;) )
8875,Business Skills for Data Science: What are they REALLY?,"Thanks for your very informative video :) I'm very technical, so it was very helpful for me :) I would also be interested in a video about how to talk with different people :)"

8880,Business Skills for Data Science: What are they REALLY?,"I think business strategy is important for data scientists, and then learning to deal with ambiguity. Business majors are great at dealing with ambiguity where as technical people such as engineers, data scientists etc struggle with a lot. By ambiguity, I mean that in business, 1 + 1 does not equal 2... it could equal 3 or 5 or -2."

Though I'm still struggling in picking up the data science skills, I hope to bring awareness of AI power to more people from the manufacturing industry.

One question regarding Google Colab though. Do you use the TPU setup or the GPU setup? I've been told that TPU performance is a lot better than GPU's and I was curious what you actually use?


Also, I recently got into Work From Home setup and it seems to me that you have a very minimalist-style setup where you can focus on your work efficiently. Would you be willing to share your setup if you don't mind in your future video?

Hoping you are staying safe as well!"

Just a quick update-


If your ctrl + alt is not working in spyder then use F9 or edit your settings.
You can refer to this video-
https://youtu.be/8r2gMyt8BS8


Also during plotting graphs if it shows this-
Figures now render in the Plots pane by default. To make them also appear inline in the Console, uncheck ""Mute Inline Plotting"" under the Plots pane options menu.

I'm a beginner and need some help. Whenever I run code, on my ""Console 1/A"" window on the bottom right of the Spyder IDE it doesn't show the output of the code.


Instead it spits out:  runcell(0, 'file path location of current file code is being type in')



For example, if I type in a 7 like you did and try to run it . this is what I get for the output on the console.


ln [2]: runcell(0, 'C:/Users/James/.spyder-py3/temp.py')


How do I fix this so I can see the output of my code ? This is mainly annoying because I can't even see the first few rows of the dataframe when you called  .head() because this is the output I keep getting, help :("

8964,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 17 (Best Portfolio Website Yet?),"Is LaTex commonly used to write up a data science paper? If not, what software do practicing data scientists use? MS Word?"
8965,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 17 (Best Portfolio Website Yet?),Thank you Ken for the detailed overview! I was wondering how Alexander embedded his project into the webpage? I saw your video on creating a Github Pages portfolio (led by Chanin the Data Professor) and I thought the way he integrated his project there is quite cool.
8966,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 17 (Best Portfolio Website Yet?),Is Alexander picking his nose in his profile picture? lol
8967,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 17 (Best Portfolio Website Yet?),"Wow, he really does have a very impressive resume! The level of detail he put into his projects is just insane, especially for someone who even has a different background!

I think it would be great to see Tina and Danny review projects as well, that would probably give them more attention on this platform as well! ;)"
8968,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 17 (Best Portfolio Website Yet?),"Hey Ken, I was not sure if you saw the response I made on your scraping glassdoor video. But here is the code that scrapes the titles of glass door. 

The main advantages are that it is more efficient(code wise) and it is much faster then selenium. I also did this in beautiful soup which Is not a super scalable library, but it illustrates the power of scraping tools. If you want to scale on a larger level, I recommend learning scrapy. Additionally, there is also a tool available that lets you select the exact css element of a web-page I will re-link it again. Anyways, here is the code that scrapes the job titles for glassdoor. 

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from urllib.request import urlopen,Request
import pandas as pd 
import random
import pickle



headers = {""User-Agent"": ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.3""}



website = ""https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/data-scientist-jobs-SRCH_KO0,14.htm""

for i in range(1):
    req = Request(website, headers=headers)
    page = urlopen(req)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
    for item in soup.select("".jobLink span""):
        print(item.get_text())


Lastly, you may be wondering how to go to different pages with the code and how you can scrape elements that are not on the front page of the website. Well to answer the former, you would implement a technique called pagination (I will link an article for this) and for the latter, you would scrape each link on the website and iterate through each page collecting all the elements contained on each page."

8989,Predicting Crypto-Currency Price Using RNN lSTM & GRU,"This one is an old video but nowadays Crypto-Currency is really good to invest.  

Hey Ken, What are your thoughts about Crypto-Currency at present? Or Which changes will you do if you want to rebuild a similar project?"

8993,Predicting Crypto-Currency Price Using RNN lSTM & GRU,Hi ken jee
8994,Predicting Crypto-Currency Price Using RNN lSTM & GRU,"Ken, thanks a lot for your sharing. may I ask how much crypto-currency you have earned using the model?  : )"
8995,Predicting Crypto-Currency Price Using RNN lSTM & GRU,Thanks for New approach
8996,Predicting Crypto-Currency Price Using RNN lSTM & GRU,"No benchmark. 60% is low if the price is in a trend.    FOr financial data, deep learning is not very useful, at least at this stage."
8997,Predicting Crypto-Currency Price Using RNN lSTM & GRU,"The problem with these sort of codes is that you are predicting the past. It just follows the line of the past and can't make predictions for the future. So if you want to loose money, go a head and use this technique."

9009,Data Science Resume Round-Up With @Tina Huang  | Episode 3,"Hey, Ken!
In another video you adviced against putting your picture on your resume. One of the reasons is that it may hinder the efficiency of screening apps.

You advice against putting icons on the resume too? for example, the icons in https://d.novoresume.com/images/blogs/55839c90-6d75-11e8-9ca8-6d365b13efdc/it-resume.png"

I've listed several projects, skills, and certifications, but should I also put work experience even if it's unrelated? how would you recommend a  beginner resume like this be structured?"

With this series, one always finds optimization potential in one's resume!"
9013,Data Science Resume Round-Up With @Tina Huang  | Episode 3,"Hey Ken! Thanks for another great video.
I have a question about projects on resumes. I am struggling to think of ways to quantify the purpose of projects beyond just the results of different machine learning models. Because the results are not really put to use after finding them, there is no real quantitative impact to put on the resume (such as a 10% increase in sales).  Is it necessary or suggested to have this for your projects? If so, what ways might you go about restructuring/expanding upon data science projects to address their possible ""lack of usability"" ?"
9014,Data Science Resume Round-Up With @Tina Huang  | Episode 3,"Please can you make video on this ""How to choose algorithm for machine learning""."
9015,Data Science Resume Round-Up With @Tina Huang  | Episode 3,Hey Ken! Another video idea for the pile: a video on the maths you need to do data science and the best places to learn it. I've been slowing working my way through the Mathematics for Machine Learning textbook and it's hard work for someone who never did maths outside of high school.

9019,Data Science Resume Round-Up With @Tina Huang  | Episode 3,Learnt a lot 🤣😃 wow
9020,Data Science Resume Round-Up With @Tina Huang  | Episode 3,"Hey Ken, I’m really enjoying this series, I just have a quick question. If I was crunched on space in fitting all the projects I’ve done, would you say it’s better to keep your most recent projects on your resume OR would you rather advise to keep the projects that are relevant to the position/company you are applying to although it’s been 2-3 years since you’ve worked on that specific project?"
9021,Data Science Resume Round-Up With @Tina Huang  | Episode 3,Thanks for another great resume review! It gave me a lot of ideas of how I can improve my own resume.
9022,Data Science Resume Round-Up With @Tina Huang  | Episode 3,"hey ken , should we describe the personal projects we did in the resume or just mentioning them with an understandable name is enough? thanks"

The insight you provide is so valuable, even in careers beyond data science. I'm doing my PhD in Chemistry but I've really taken an interest in data science over the past few months. Right now I've been applying machine learning to help develop low-cost COVID diagnostic platforms in our laboratory. I still have a lot to learn but who knows, maybe one day you'll be reviewing my resume!"
9025,Data Science Resume Round-Up With @Tina Huang  | Episode 3,"Now every algorithms works in order to show what we want to watch say YouTube, Google Ads etc.. So sir my question is doesn't it makes us less interested in exploring new things. What if algorithms only shows content based on our past results and never lets us know new things. Suppose i don't have any idea what is deep learning and even didn't hear it before. So how it is likely that one will get to know about it, just by recommendation system or any other search result. 

Sorry it might sounds weird 😬"

9076,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 1 (Exploratory Analysis),"Hey Ken,
(warning: longer comment incoming)
I've been following you for a few months now and I've been thinking
""Man, I really need to write a comment stating how much I appreciate this channel"",
but I have been putting it of for long enough, this video finally drove me to the keyboard.
It is really inspiring to see you consistently trying to upload informative videos about Data Science
and really giving back to the community. You are a great motivation for me to keep going
and striving towards a career in Data Science (or even Machine Learning Engineering).
I clicked through your social links and noticed that you have a really well documented system
including your GitHub, personal website. Medium posts and this YouTube-Channel.
With a full time job besides all of that it is really impressive to me how you can manage all of these sources
and be so consistent with it. I'd love to have my project reviewed by you, even though at the moment my GitHub
is my least well documented source (xD). But you definitely inspired me to put more time and effort
into polishing personal projects and really not letting loose on those last 20%.
I am almost certain, that within a year or two your channel will become very impactful in the DS community
and that you will see very positive results. Your content is very informative and helping.
If I tried to point out some minor areas of improval it would actually not be based on the content itself, but rather
on aspects surrounding it (such as presentation, background noise, ... ) but I am sure you are aware of this,
recently I have noticed quite some improvement in those areas as well, so all I can say is chapeau!
I am really excited to see how far you will come in the next months, you definitely won me as a loyal fan of yours :)"

Would you say it's pretty late for me to get into the field? Can you suggest ways that late-comers into the field might find an edge for themselves? What would you say or advise as an employer or someone hiring new data scientists? What would make an older applicant/late-comer more of an attractive employee or colleague compared to younger applicants?"

I do have a small request. Could you perhaps remove the background music in your videos? Sometimes the music comes off as irritating and given that the main content of your videos is the dialogue, I feel like it's unnecessary to have the background music for the type of videos you make.

9100,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 14 [Deep Learning Focus],"Thank you for making this informative video Sir! You stated that inculcation of an additional discipline along with Data Science provides a boost to your resume, however for students who are aspiring to be data scientists and will shortly join college, how will they be able to get the added benefit of having experience in another discipline. If I restrict my argument to myself, I will be pursuing either a DS or a CS under graduate degree, how can I compete against individuals who have the added edge of another discipline. 
Another question I have is could you do a full tutorial style video on how one goes about making their profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, GitHub or Stack Overflow (And which platform carries the most weight in recruiters' eyes), as an adolescent I feel daunted by the thought of making a good profile as not only am I inexperienced but I'm also unaware of the do's and dont's. Videos such as these project reviews are extremely useful for more experienced watchers but a video targeted towards the newcomers would be a boon. 
PS: If you can please tell what name you decided on for your new PC

Once again thank you for making these videos, I cannot stress enough how helpful they are!"

Do you utilize any methods to capture the data at  the source of the activities (e.g.; fitness tracker)?"
9120,How to Stay Productive & Motivated When Learning Data Science,Thank you for 5 tips and for sharing your spreadsheet.  Your Data Science Beginners playlist is helping me to explore more about data science........
9121,How to Stay Productive & Motivated When Learning Data Science,Thank you it's very helpful !!
9122,How to Stay Productive & Motivated When Learning Data Science,I am so much thank ful to you bro. I'm currently down and overwhelmed about this I've been learning about 3 months without a break and still I know nothing when I read source code form others kaggle note book and I'm so depressed. Sigh.. life long learning
9123,How to Stay Productive & Motivated When Learning Data Science,This is so good to hear. I'm trying to learn data science skills these days and for the past couple of days I've been feeling low. But ill be back on track soon. Thanks for the video Ken. Its pretty motivational !!
9124,How to Stay Productive & Motivated When Learning Data Science,"Hey Ken! Thanks for the tips; I’m steadily habituating many of these practices, and with greater intention after watching the video. 

Question: what are you using that small whiteboard on your desk for? I have a similar one that I’m trying to determine a purpose for. . ."
9125,How to Stay Productive & Motivated When Learning Data Science,"Thank you for the tips Ken! I especially agree with the ""starting small"" part. In the past, I used to just consume most of my daily time to that new habit during the initial phase. I would just see starting small as being ""not good enough"". However, I realized that this was causing me to have burnouts frequently. So even though changing your ""bad habits"" is hard, I am trying to apply this advice and I can already see its benefits."
9126,How to Stay Productive & Motivated When Learning Data Science,"These tips are something that most don't bother about, neither about learning them, nor teaching them to people, thank for the initiatives."
9127,How to Stay Productive & Motivated When Learning Data Science,Thank u!

9132,How to Stay Productive & Motivated When Learning Data Science,"Ken, great video. Can you post that spreadsheet to github? 


I come from a non technical background. My major is supply chain management with a minor in information systems. I took a data science course and did well in it. The course mainly covered more advanced statistical concepts, not so much of programming (I lack in computer skills the most). I really enjoyed the course. I currently work as a business analyst. I am considering taking your advice to get a master's degree in Data Science from the University of Michigan. Thanks for the information you provide on this channel!"

9143,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,liked and subscribed Thanku
9144,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,"Hey Ken, I am a really big fan of all of your content and you have truly inspired me to enter the field of data science and sports analytics. I am an incoming college freshman (math major)and I have been learning SQL and python through code academy. Other than projects, do you have any tips to make myself stand out in order to get an internship? I hope to intern with the Los Angeles Lakers analytics team and I could really use some advice. Your videos and website(playing numbers) are the most helpful resources related to the field that I have been able to find, keep up the great work!"
9145,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,"I'm moving to Munich with a maths degree statistics and programming knowledge. Its nice to see this video to remind me that i don't have to be an expert to get an internship. Thanks Ken, your videos as very informational and motivating."
9146,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,Thanx
9147,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,"This was really useful! many thanks. I just have one question:
how would you recommend me to include a previous experience in developing a business in my CV? Thanks a lot again!"
9148,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,"Great advice! I hate interviews, and really don’t look forward to them. I choke and get really stressed. I perform better when allowed to produce something rather then answer on the top of my head :)"
9149,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,"Great video!
Generally I think the younger someone is
(or in general the earlier someone stands in their career/education)
the more impressive extraordinary projects become.
If you're a high school student and you create your own DS project whilst 
collecting own data, that is a lot more impressive than if you're in your final graduate year.
Even though it is never too late to start, I really want to try and make cool
projects early on so that I can build momentum as early as possible.
With the DS market becoming more and more competitive, I think these
uncommon achievements are going to be valued more and more,
especially in larger companies (FANG etc.) where already today
they are probably more of a requirement than an add-on.
Nevertheless, great video! I really hope to land an awesome internship myself in the coming year(s)."
9150,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,"Hey Ken, great video as always. Curious to hear your thoughts on the Spyder IDE as I saw it being used in this video. Any standout reasons you use it over Jupyter/VSCode/etc?"
9151,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,"Hey Ken, thanks for the great video. I have been watching all your videos and they are greatly helpful! I have a question though. At 2:04, you mentioned that ""if you want to set yourself apart, you should consider doing unique projects on the dataset you personally collected."" Are there any efficient ways I can collect new dataset?"
9152,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,"Great video, Ken, hope you don’t mind me sharing. I’ve hosted 1-2 interns every year, and agreed with all your points, particularly the successful interns were those with the skills you’ve mentioned (e.g. R or Python) as well as a GitHub portfoilio of hobby projects (reaffirming their interest and passion for data science). And one of the most important point is to double check that we addressed the potential employer with their name instead of “Dear Sir/Madam”, it goes to show that we have at least personalized the letter to them. Once again, great video and great insights Ken!"
9153,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,"Hi, Ken. Thanks for sharing helpful tips! I wish I found your advices in earlier years in college. I’m a new graduate without any intern experience. Can you give me an idea of how I can find research opportunities at this point? Thanks in advance!"
9154,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,"Thanks for the tips! I had planned a astronomy / machine learning internship at a university in PA for the summer. The program has since been cancelled due to COVID :( But luckily, I applied to a data science intern position at a startup and got it :)"
9155,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,"Thanks your share, i'm a 2nd  software engineering student but i want to become a ds in the future. I'm really not good in math, can you give me some advice, sir?"
9156,What You Need to Know for a Data Science Internship,"This video inspired me to look into internships for this summer, something I wasn't planning on doing because I didn't think I was qualified. Thank you for asking!"

9206,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),💯... Podcasting can help us to improve communication.
9207,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),You’re motivating me. Thanks Ken
9208,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),how to start? where to start a podcast?
9209,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),"It's amazing to hear you say that you also struggled and stumbled over your words early on. I've wanted to start a podcast for months now but I'm fairly introverted so I've been putting it off. Your comment about controlling the environment instead of being controlled by it hit the nail on the head and I've never thought about it that way.

Thanks for sharing that Ken! That's something that I'll remember for a long time."
9210,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),"As the saying goes ""Surround yourself with 4 billionaires and you will be the 5th"",so I believe talking and have a conversation with great minds make you great.
I am wondering how do you manage job, content creation and then podcast as I am sure it will require a lot of time to do research about guest prior to episode."
9211,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),"When are you planning to invite ""Papaya"" as a podcast guest 😁😁😁"
9212,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),"Hey I stumbled across your channel and been enjoying the content. I really want to do a intermediate data analytics project (ideally with SQL, Python tableau etc) but struggle for good ideas, I don’t want to just do a basic get csv data set and analysis but want to do bit more in depth and challenging, do you have any ideas? Thank you"
9213,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),"Agreed 100%, I also feel that it helps me to understand myself better as well. Do you think it’s possible for the next guest on Ken’s Nearest Neighbors to be Ken Jee? Ken interviews Ken, would be an awesome episode :)"
9214,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),You know.... Thank you for this. I'll give it a shot.
9215,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),Started a small YouTube channel and it helped me practice communication and storytelling skills to recently land a Data Engineer Consultant role. Definitely agree haha
9216,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),What are your thoughts on live podcasting? I'm curious how much editing you're currently doing...
9217,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),I really like your podcast ! I was wondering how much time does it take doing research on the guest ? Or maybe as time goes by you don't need to prepare as much as before ?
9218,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),6:26 I made the cut!! I’m also a very animated talker… my hands help tell the story 😂
9219,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),"KNN is really a great channel with great content, I love the style of ""insert situation/problem"" as the video/podcast topic, this makes it a lot better for someone to relate to."
9220,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),🌸🙏🏽🌞
9221,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),"I'm thinking of starting sort of an anti-podcast and titling it something super awkward like, ""Nobody Should Listen to This Podcast."" I'd describe it as an arrogant jerk and his (formerly) inner monologue. 

That way, it's half satirical reverse psychology, half self-sabotage. Which is sort of my thing, really. 😁"
9222,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),"I started a podcast mainly coz I just wanted to learn how to talk to people. To get out of my social awkwardness. And it worked!! Absolutely agree with all the points you have made and even though I have only done 2-3 episodes I can relate very much!! Am very much looking forward to resume my podcast work after my college applications and all thanks to you Ken!! 🐢🐢🐢

My podcast isn't that interesting, it's completely random hahaha(It did make Tina laugh tho 🤡). Let's see if my brain helps me to make interesting content 🤠🤠🐢🐢"
9223,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),"You make a good case that podcasting can bring you lots of benefits. Similar to blogging. But also similar to blogging for personal gain, is this something we want to be promoting? Shouldn't we only create content that we think might be valuable to others? 
As an example, Medium has some amazing blogs to learn data science, but is also filled to the brim with garbage blogs that where data science beginners show off their skills while only pretending to educate or provide value to others. These blogs waste other people's time, and crowd out the good stuff making it harder to find.
I don't want to be elitist and say that only the best blogs/podcast should exist, but I feel like this 'just throw it out there and let the internet decide' may not be the best approach"
9224,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),Love your videos watching when you upload
9225,Why EVERYONE Should Start a Podcast (Including YOU),"Thanks for watching everyone! I hope this video gets you as excited about podcasting as I am!

9227,Land a Data Science Job in a Different Country (Vijay Pravin Maharajan) - KNN EP. 13,"Sorry for my second comment and request in the same video, but it would be very nice if you could do a video on the possibilities of transitioning to Data Science coming from a social sciences background beyond economics (sociology, anthropology, history and/or any field that requires analytical thinking and may involve qualitative research). I'm thinking either of a research context (ex masters or PhD students) or simply BS/BA graduates. Thank you again."
9228,Land a Data Science Job in a Different Country (Vijay Pravin Maharajan) - KNN EP. 13,"Congratulations for expanding your channel's scope beyond the US, Ken Jee. You are doing an amazing job. I'd like to thank you in the name of non-US to-be data scientists and ask you, if possible and convenient, to do a video on making it to the Data Science field in the Brazilian context, if it is the case that you already know any successful Brazilian data scientist. Best wishes."
9229,Land a Data Science Job in a Different Country (Vijay Pravin Maharajan) - KNN EP. 13,"Great interview! As someone from Europe I am particularly interested in the entire process outside of the US,
since currently there is not a lot of information on this topic online.
One small note; at some points in the video, especially when the audio of you talking is a bit low,
the music makes it a bit more difficult to follow along. Still an awesome discussion tho! :)"

I watched your Data Science Project from sctach series and found it very beneficial. I was wondering if you could make a video targeted at beginners as to what kind of EDA we should be doing depending on our data, maybe explain some of the statistics knowledge needed when picking features to use in models etc (not necessarily how to create plots as you did this in your EDA episode of the ds project series).

He does this before he splits his data into the test and train set which causes data leakage (Not as much as a naive upsampling method but since nearest neighbours is being used, some leakage is happening meaning it's generalisability beyond this dataset may be limited) - just thought that would be helpful for anyone using oversampling methods."
9246,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 10 (Leveraging Your Data),"Hello Ken Jee,
I really like your videos. I have one weird request I always wonder what topic( tips, formulas, notes) should we have on walls so that I could go through it every day. And I have seen in some of the videos that you are having some lists (Notes) on your walls. 
If you don't mind can you please make a video or share details on it, please.
Thank you!!"

After watching your videos, I've tried doing projects from Kaggle, but my technical skills for completing projects on my own are quite not there to show off to hiring managers. I recently was contacted by a recruiting firm that provides SAS training and get assistance getting into a first SAS programmer role, it will take me 3 months to get a certificate and possibly get the role. I'm thinking maybe 1 year of experience as a SAS programmer can help me to get a feeling of data analytics field, and continue to learn Python on the side. Could you advise if this could be a helpful route for me?"

9292,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 4 (Resume & Github),hey! I sent you an email requesting to have my resume reviewed. thanks
9293,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 4 (Resume & Github),Great video Ken! I like how you focused on the findings and not just the model! It's something that people don't talk about but we need to give it more focus! Keep up the great work!
9294,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 4 (Resume & Github),"good review! I think this shows once again that documentation is really crucial. In the end it does not matter how many incredible projects someone made, if they can't showcase and explain them clearly, even if this sounds harsh. This really motivates me to improve my own resume, I'm working on it but because I'm from Germany I actually have to translate my homepage so that I can send it out to international recruiters if needed, and that takes up some time as well :D
I think your advice really is valuable even to people outside the US, even though of course the formalities may differ, f.e. in Europe it is much more common (or even expected) to include a personal photo on the resume, but I think that the essence of interviews and what recruiters look for is generally the same across the countries, especially for larger companies like FANG etc. I think the interview process does not differ much. For smaller companies though there can of course be differences."

9301,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 4 (Resume & Github),My first time on this Series and I think I will love it.
9302,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 4 (Resume & Github),"Hello, Ken. Regarding the applicability of your advices outside the US, I can speak about Brazil (my home country) and France (the country I currently live). Basically, everything you said so far applies equally to both places, specially regarding the number of pages in the CV. I've been working with engineering for some time now, and in Brazil I see a certain tendency of giving more importance to soft skills than to technical skills, at least in my area. The idea is that you can teach somebody how to program, for example, but it's really hard to teach someone how to have be a good team player. Watching youtube videos about data science I have the impression that on the US the job interviews focus a lot on asking technical questions, but I'm not sure if it's the same through all types of jobs."

9312,Data Science Explained with ... Cooking?,"My cooking and Data science analogy is :
The more you cook the more better Chef you become, similarly the more project you build the better data scientist you will be."
9313,Data Science Explained with ... Cooking?,"@Ken! This video tells me that you really REALLY like cooking =) Who would go through this for a data science video without love for food and cooking?! Great analogies! I want to add one more to your analogies if I may... Good quality food = Good quality data. Often times neglected, but makes the most impact =) Also, here is a riddle for all foodies and people who loves to cook. I came up with this after many years of cooking and baking. Here it is: What is in every recipe that you doesn't have a taste? The answer also makes sense from the data science perspective =)"
9314,Data Science Explained with ... Cooking?,"#66 + 2: This is great Ken, now on I will never forget the steps with the cooking analogy :)
It's really funny how you talk about the cooking tools; when it's the moment I literally will draw a picture of an oven, stove, etc to remember each method 🥘
As always, thank you!

9323,Data Science Explained with ... Cooking?,One more common thing here guys.... We try to build a project by different methods or by different algorithms and in the same way we try to make a dish by using different methods....
9324,Data Science Explained with ... Cooking?,Hey Ken this is interesting... I also cook sometimes but never tried to relate this with data science but you have explained it very well..... I will definitely try this....I hope this will also improve my cooking 😁
9325,Data Science Explained with ... Cooking?,Amazing analogy! I'll definitely borrow this when I need to explain what data science is
9326,Data Science Explained with ... Cooking?,"Muchas gracias,  este video esta muy bien explicado, +1 suscrito"
9327,Data Science Explained with ... Cooking?,That was truly creative. The analogy was simple to follow and relate to. Thanks for sharing!

My goal is to someday be a data scientist, but I realize that is going to take me several months if not years to obtain such role, and have since been solely focusing on acquiring enough skills to land an entry-level data analyst job. I was unable to get assistance from the VA to pursue a master's in data science degree, so now I am left to my own defenses in learning these skills on my own. I have been using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for nearly a year now.  I have completed a handful of data analyst projects and posted them on GitHub. I have over a year with using SQL.

Especially I get confused like when I take up theory I tend to take theory as I do not understand the things used and why and when doing theory I tend that I am lacking the practical. I end up really end doing absolute nothing.
I really am looking for such a thing and would really help not only for me but all of the aspirants in India. Please may it available for enthusiast like us .Please can you make it available in India.

9365,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 6 (Only 3 months of coding experience),"Hi Ken, i need your honest opinion man

I'm confused in choosing between Data Scientist or UX Designer

There are few questions about this topic, but i want to ask from different perspective

I am right now a content creator, was a videographer so i do edit videos and such

Visualization is always a part of me, i like to vizualize things like when i hear music i can imagine the videos that fits the music

But what i asked is much bigger than that

I know lots of people talk about what you're more into, if maths go with data science, if creative go with ux design

However, i want to know how's the life of both careers? Which one offer better work life balance?

Because when i did creative work, i didn't really have work life balance, i did a lot of overwork stuffs, because creative work sometimes requires you to think constantly or out of the box that really absorbed your attention even outside of your work hours.

When i go outside, my body is in holiday mode but my mind is not there, thinking of the unfinished project.

Then second, which one is more important and irreplaceable? Because i see lots of websites now offering design templates which mean maybe in the future, companies don't really need ux designer since they can use good templates from the internet. 

Third, when you become the CEO of the company. Which skill is best to master? Data science or ux design? That will absolute critical as someone in that position. 

Like to hear your thoughts about this, thank you"

9368,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 6 (Only 3 months of coding experience),"Thanks Ken for reviewing my project, this will help me a lot.
Some wrote, that I'm not a beginner, but it´s true. I started coding for the first time, with the beginning of the pandemic in March. I enjoyed it and also I had nothing else to do in the lockdown, so I invested whole days in learning Python/Data Science; Watched a lot of tutorials with 2.5x speed.
Ken´s project series from scratch inspired me to start my own project. The result you can see in this video. But it was a lot of time and effort to get to this point. So, it´s a nice compliment, when someone thinks, that my project can´t be from a beginner. 
Also, I hope this motivates people, who are now at the beginning."
9369,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 6 (Only 3 months of coding experience),"Hey, Ken, I’m a newbie in DS field and just getting started with my studying. Which online platform would u recommend to start from? What r ur thoughts on Dataquest?"
9370,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 6 (Only 3 months of coding experience),"Hey, Ken, I'm new to the data science, so I wanted to ask you a question. A lot of people say that the most important thing that data scientist should make is ""value"". However, I saw a lot of popular notebooks on Kaggle with complex algorithms but without any explanation of the reasoning behind them (e.g. doing sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews but without mentioning why it might be beneficial).
So my question is ""Is explaining the reasons behind your actions and mentioning the value of your work important?"""

For real no joke I had one identical to it and wouldn't replace it with anything.  Comfy as a MF'r!!!  Love you're videos and the no non-sense fluff approach.  Just getting started in DS, Python, R and Sports Analytics but have set goals and want to take it far."
9383,Why Right NOW is a Great Time to Learn Data Science,"Hey Ken, the dropbox link provided isn't working. Cheers."
9384,Why Right NOW is a Great Time to Learn Data Science,Would you recommend I learn a language like python first before I dive in to data science?
9385,Why Right NOW is a Great Time to Learn Data Science,Hey Everyone - It looks like the free 365 data science courses offer has expired. The rest of the resource that I mentioned in this video are free though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip50cXvpWY4

9391,Why Right NOW is a Great Time to Learn Data Science,"Great video as always, but I will say this is a serious understatement.  Now that I'm out of work,  I am ever so glad that I have decided  to pursue this career path. Three great reasons to pursue data science: 1. Do something positive for society and gain a strong sense of purpose. 2. Something to keep the mind stimulated which can greatly help with depression and anxiety. 3. A solid career that can potentially help someone avoid being homeless and going down a dark path. I think these are solid enough reasons to purse this field."

Industry is rocked right now, so I'm learning some Data Science on the side, and your videos are helping :)"
9395,Why Right NOW is a Great Time to Learn Data Science,"Great video. When you say you expect the work culture to shift towards employees working from home, do you mean in the short-term i.e. while the pandemic is still going on, or do you see this just being the ""new"" working environment? Interesting insight."
9396,Why Right NOW is a Great Time to Learn Data Science,Can you suggest a good youtube channel or website for learning a good amount of python for data science.
9397,Why Right NOW is a Great Time to Learn Data Science,Thankyou ken

9402,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 11(GITHUB CLEANING),"What do you recommend doing for a review of the interpretability of project outcomes. Let’s say I’m working on an econometrics project on my own, what’s the best place or way to review that I’m drawing the correct conclusions from my results? A lot of data science online sources simply take you through the code and the outputs but don’t go into how to make sure you’re drawing all conclusions from the model."
9403,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 11(GITHUB CLEANING),"Another nice video.

Ken, I have a question here. Which one is better, do we have to put one project in one repository or do we put several projects in one repository? For instance, this repository is a repository for the projects that I have done by taking a dataset from Kaggle. 

Thank you Ken"

9449,How to Simulate NBA Games in Python,"Hi Ken!
Thank you for this video, I just used your code and built my own little model! Using 2020 data and looking back at the NBA games from back in March I would've correctly picked 9 of the 13 NBA over/unders correctly.
This is a small sample size, but I believe the model I have is pretty accurate. However, I was wondering how I would make it more accurate? Like what new data points I should add to predict the score. I'm very excited about the return of the NBA."

Also, what is the point of having your image in the lower right-hand corner.  Does you image make it easier to comprehend what concepts and ideas your expressing?  All that negative space is distracting from your content, which is interesting e"
9455,How to Simulate NBA Games in Python,"Ken, great stuff! Thanks for walking us through your simulation. 

Quick question: the way you calculate the score seems to skew the comparisons if one of the scores is high. 

For example:

If one team score is say 140-139 it averages to approx 140. The other team score is 120-90. It averages 105. So the team that won by 1 gets the win in the sim cause they scored a lot of points. But the other team won by 30 and had a better defense.

Do you see my point?

I'm thinking you ought to subtract and return a margin of victory then compare the margin of victory. Maybe worth running simulations to see how different they are?

Thanks again!"

9500,Data Science Fundamentals: Linear Regression,"Thanks for this video. Started using SPYDER IDE, liking it over VS Studio and Jupyter Lab. VS had issues with the Jup extension, not plotting the null heatmap with 400k rows. When comparing to your current videos (late 2020), your content presentation has improved DRASTICALLY. Thanks again!"
9501,Data Science Fundamentals: Linear Regression,"Thanks for making these videos! I know its niche, but it's extremely helpful!"
9502,Data Science Fundamentals: Linear Regression,"Hi Ken, this is so helpful...but I do not get why does the constant appear on my co-relation plot!"
9503,Data Science Fundamentals: Linear Regression,"Hi there Ken! As always, your video is really helpful for someone who just started learning about data science, in the line 41 and 42, why would you apply the lower/upper change only to data.desc.head instead of data.head? Thanks for the informative video, I learned a lot from it!!"
9504,Data Science Fundamentals: Linear Regression,"Hi Ken! Your videos are tremendously helpful. Thank you. I need some direction please. I was trying to replicate your  steps here. 
When I ran  : 'scores = cross_val_score(reg4,x4,y4, cv=5, scoring= 'neg_mean-squared-error')'. Here was the bug I got:

ValueError: 'neg_mean-squared-error' is not a valid scoring value. Use sorted(sklearn.metrics.SCORERS.keys()) to get valid 
options.

Could you assist please"
9505,Data Science Fundamentals: Linear Regression,"Wow, a very detailed lesson on single and multi regression with cross-validation. regarding your comment to have the actual selling price information, is it for error computation or for model fitting? will there be leakage if use in model fitting? thanks."
9506,Data Science Fundamentals: Linear Regression,"Hi Ken,
At the cross validation part, why didn't you check for the R^2 for the 5 different tests too?
Thanks for the video!"
9507,Data Science Fundamentals: Linear Regression,Another query. Why do we have to set the variables like odometer and price into specific format or  scale them?
9508,Data Science Fundamentals: Linear Regression,So first we perform data manipulation and cleaning which you taught in the previous videos before linear regression right ?
9509,Data Science Fundamentals: Linear Regression,"Hi Ken, 
at 8:58, the boxplots of the  price and odometer look the same after removing the outliers. 
I am quite confused. Could you explain a little further? 

Thanks"

9552,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 9 (Professional Violinist),"Hey Ken, 

does it matter whether my project goes into the model production aspects? Would it seem too lackluster to just cover exploratory data analysis aspects? 

Also, does the model production aspect require machine learning? or is it even just things like prediction in regression?

Thanks again!"
9553,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 9 (Professional Violinist),"Another awesome video. Thanks Ken.

9560,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 9 (Professional Violinist),"I just spent the last several months learning data science and I thought I was ready to start applying for jobs.  I did so this morning and to my great disappointment, I found that every entry level position required 2 years of experience and already had 100 applicants.  This gives me very unpleasant flashbacks to trying to apply for entry level electrical engineering jobs after I graduated.  I do not believe there is any quantity of hobby projects I could do that would allow me to enter this market.  I'm sorry, but your entire channel is a waste of time."
9561,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 9 (Professional Violinist),Awesome suggestion ken! I have known Keshav for quite sometime and iam sure he will go places.
9562,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 9 (Professional Violinist),Another awesome video on resume review 😃👍

9574,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 2 (Resume and Portfolio),"Awesome video picked up on a couple of things I never would have guessed. Also, the personal website through github is something I'd defintely look forward to seeing.
Cheers!"
9575,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 2 (Resume and Portfolio),"I really like how you stress the important parts and flesh out the points with bits of practical explanation like you did with the resume layout or the documentation.
This really is good advice and definitely a resource a lot of people who are not incredibly experienced in the field can benefit from.
I don't have a lot more to say than just the fact that I enjoyed watching it and thank you for the helpful insights!"
9576,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 2 (Resume and Portfolio),"Really like this kind of series! Definitely helpful for  the aspiring data scientists.

How about a video on how to build a personal portfolio website??"
9577,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 2 (Resume and Portfolio),"Hey Ken, great video as always! 

Would it be possible for you to make a video on some examples of technical interview questions? I was looking through your channel and couldn't find such videos. Hope this is not too much to ask for..

Thanks!"
9578,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 2 (Resume and Portfolio),great video ken...
9579,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 2 (Resume and Portfolio),"Ken, Great video and insights on preparing a strong resume! Agreed that documentation is a plus for potential employers, a well documented code/notebook goes a long way in reproducibility of data science projects. Speaking of making websites and hosting on GitHub, Hugo (https://gohugo.io/) is a great tool, it is a static site generator that automatically creates a website directly from markdown files and it could be hosted on the github.io. Best of all, there's a large selection of themes to select from. Personally, I use it to create our research group's website http://codes.bio/"
9580,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 2 (Resume and Portfolio),Hi Ken. This video was very helpful. I would really appreciate the video idea you mentioned of how to build your own website on Github. I have one on Wix but I think having one on Github would be better. Thank you
9581,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 2 (Resume and Portfolio),"Thank you for continuing the series.
I have a question lets just suppose I have done 3 or more online courses regarding data science, what do you recommend putting on the courses sections all the courses of some specific. If some specific one then how to choose which one.
Thanks in advance."
9582,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 2 (Resume and Portfolio),Another awesome video. :) Would you make a video going over LinkedIn tips?
9583,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 2 (Resume and Portfolio),"Hi, Ken. What do you mostly do at work? Build models, clean data or something else?"

9585,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,No its because someones clearly hacking my account but nobody cares!
9586,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,Youtube randomly suggest me this video 😁
9587,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,Now isn't that a nice example for the human concept of 'fate'
9588,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,"Short answer: You can’t code randomness, it doesn’t exist. You can only code things which feel like randomness to us, so basically how our brain understand it.

Long unclear answer: watch the video"
9589,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,came here from the newsletter :D
9590,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,"Hi, ken. do you recommend m1 MacBook for ml and deep learning?"
9591,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,"Hi, can I use open source code (it doesn't have a license) in my app which I plan to make commercially available? Thanks"
9592,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,Something to think about 🤔
9593,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,This video and a David Goggins video appeared side-by-side in my recommended videos.  It was a really hard decision but I obviously chose the more favorite one to watch! 😜 Now I have to go run 100 miles to pay for this decision....
9594,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,"Would've never guessed that they implemented an algorithm that's actually less random, interesting.

I was just ""randomly"" thinking about this the other day too"
9595,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,I feel like my workout playlist always starts with the same 2 songs
9596,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,"Heres a pseudo code i developed in my stupid head for random songs.
import random
A=[0,1,2,...,N]# index of each song
#Or
for i in range(0,len(A)):
A={1:""Song 1"",.....,N:""Song N""}
song_played=randrom.choice(A)
play(song_played)# plays the song
del A[song_played]

#Im not an expert ,so if there's anything #wrong please point out respectfully"
9597,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,"So, Can we say that sometimes algorithms produce their own pattern or results which maybe be completely different from what we are expecting?"
9598,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,"🤔 Yeah, have always wondered about that, thanks for demystifying this for us Ken! Thinking out loud, I can imagine that by chance a random selection may select songs by the same artist or from the same era and as you've mentioned Spotify probably imposes a filter for the aforementioned which makes it less random."
9599,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,How interesting ! I can see how the algorithm would prevent a succession of songs by the same person. Although personally I have a personal playlist that I occasionally edit.
9600,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,I think almost everyone who uses Spotify experienced this.
9601,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,I spotted the random shuffle in 'Spoitfy'.
9602,Is Spotify Shuffle Really Random? #Shorts,"I have been questioning Spotify's shuffle algorithm for about two years now. I alway felt the shuffle algorithm on my IPod nano was better than Spotify's algo. I would hear repeated shuffled songs throughout a one to two hour time span on my Spotify playlist that has 1,500 songs. I wish they could fix that."

Ken you should continue this Playlist in 2022."
9621,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 20 (Bootcamp Capstone),Really very neatly done project. I am checking his project and reading all the descriptions. Its very explanatory . Thanks Ken Jee for making video on this one. Also thanks for Q/A session at the end.
9622,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 20 (Bootcamp Capstone),"Hi Ken. Just found your channel recently and it’s been an amazing resource for me. I’m new to data science and as a former athlete, I’m hoping to work in sports analytics eventually. However I have a background working in product creation in the apparel industry for 10 years. Based on what you’ve said a few times, it seems my best path is working in data science in apparel before transitioning into sports? If I wanted to start building my portfolio, would it be weird to have projects in both categories? Should I only show apparel projects now and do sports for fun? A little confused on how I should present myself."
9623,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 20 (Bootcamp Capstone),"A question here, Ken:
As a beginner, I'm going through lots of books and tutorials to comprehend the concepts of each algorithm and how to apply them, basically using them in a project.
Many of the suggested projects for newbies have been done and posted by thousands of people, including bootcamp projects. Even if I do everything on my own thoroughly, it's still the same dataset, project, and approach. I'm wondering if it's ok to add them to my portfolio, at least until I do a little more advanced projects."
9624,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 20 (Bootcamp Capstone),"Hey Ken, What kind of projects people with 5 years of exp should have if they are willing to move into Data Science? What extra things do we add to get calls for the interview?"
9625,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 20 (Bootcamp Capstone),"Loving this project/resume series - it's just full of useful tips. I'm just about to start an MSc Data Science and I'm planning to do some project work to complement the course content. I saw that you did your undergraduate in Economics, do you have any tips for an economics undergraduate transitioning to DS?"
9626,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 20 (Bootcamp Capstone),"Amazing! Anyway, this is my first Kaggle project https://www.kaggle.com/miguelrosales/data-analysis-of-house-prices ,  I hope you can check it, Ken! Thank you as always! :)"

9628,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 20 (Bootcamp Capstone),"Oh man Ken!  I'm just starting my GA capstone project, and I was always wondering when you would review a capstone project.  This is awesome!  Maybe I'll shoot you a message when my capstone is done after October 12.  Thanks always for what you do!"
9629,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 20 (Bootcamp Capstone),"very cool project. The detail in the ReadMe is impressive. As a relative newbie,  this is quite intimidating to me.  Wondering how long it will take me to get to this level of proficiency."
9630,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 20 (Bootcamp Capstone),Thanks a ton Ken. The project you selected was really awesome on showing one of the best in class documentation. Learned quite a few points from it. Someday I shall submit my own project for your review. 🙂

It feels like you just started this series yesterday and now 20 episodes in you covered so many different resumes and projects! I believe in general, talking more about the other side is very valuable in conversation. We as humans just like talking about our own views and when a company is hiring, they of course want to know what they can ""get"" from a candidate."
9633,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 20 (Bootcamp Capstone),"Focusing on value we can create rather than the value we can receive! Excellent lessons for any stage of DS, thanks for staying up so late editing this :)"

9707,The Data Science Interview: What to Expect,"Ken, thank you for such an informative video! When you mentioned live coding interview tests, does that only include leetcode questions or could we also expect kaggle-like questions? 

From my experience, kaggle-like questions are usually take-home assignments, but I've not heard yet whether companies ask us to live code on Google doc using Pandas or something alike."

9715,Data Science Fundamentals: SQL Queries,Thanks again Ken !
9716,Data Science Fundamentals: SQL Queries,"Thank you so much, I was looking for a way to host a local server for crunching some baseball stats and you nailed the setup.

I ended up following you down your queries for fun and noticed that when I went to save my view, I got this error.

""Column names in each view or function must be unique. Column name 'playerID' in view or function 'WinningPitchers' is specified more than once.""

I found that curious since that's just from when we quoted out our join."

9720,Data Science Fundamentals: SQL Queries,Hey Ken. ¿What can I use in a Mac since SQL Server is not available for Macs?
9721,Data Science Fundamentals: SQL Queries,"Hi Ken, thanks for your sql tutorial video, which is very helpful and inspiring!. I have a question in regards to subquery you mentioned in the video.   
select bat.*, pitch.*
from dbo.Batting as bat
inner join (select *
from dbo.Pitching
where W>=10) as pitch
on bat.playerID=pitch.playerID and bat.yearID=pitch.yearID
where AB>=40
instead of using subquery in inner join, I use normal inner join and put W>=10 in where clause, which came out the same result:


select bat.*,pitch
from dbo.Batting as bat
inner join dbo.Pitching as pitch
on bat.playerID=pitch.playerID and bat.yearID=pitch.yearID
where Ab>=40 and W>=10;


my question is:  when should we use subquery? it looks complicated and easy to make a mistake during usage."

9742,Is it Important to Share Your Data Science Work? (Ft. Eric Weber),"Thanks Ken for this amazing podcast, really enjoyed the discussion. I totally agreed on sharing data science work socially. As a researcher, sharing my data science work on has opened several doors of opportunities. For one, people who see the work that I share socially may reach out to me with opportunities to apply for research grants, to take part in awesome collaborative research projects, to take part in editorial roles in research journals, prospective students reach out to join our research group, serve as the starting point for collaborative discussions, to serve as external examiners of PhD dissertation, etc. 
     As a YouTuber, I learn a lot from the subscribers (questions, suggestions, feedbacks, tips and tricks, etc.), collaborate and engage in discussions with other awesome YouTubers such as Ken Jee, Krish Naik, Dhaval Patel, Jay Feng, Jaemin Lee, etc. 
     Aside from this, the act of sharing is like paying it forward. Imagine if we all share, the collective intelligence of all the awesome ideas and works would serve as amazing resource to learn, get inspired and create further awesome data science work. 😃"

9745,Is it Important to Share Your Data Science Work? (Ft. Eric Weber),"I recently read something about digital footprints (don't remember where but there's a brazilian video that talks about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb8yXWFRROg&t=479s). It talked about how anything you do or post online, maybe a github account, or a comment on stackoverflow, anything that can help the world see you, is efficient, the important thing is to do somehting.  Sooner or later, opportunities will come.

Great video Ken. A suggestion: I think it would be nice to talk about foreigners  trying to enter the data science market (in your case in the U.S.). How it's possible, advices, maybe stereotypes or if there is much prejudice. Think it's a nice subject."

because I think it would be a lot of fun doing so.
Especially when Eric said that everyone has a personal brand,
and your choice is not if you want one or not,
but if you want to actively take part in shaping your brand or not,
this really made me reconsider the way I think about showing my work.

9757,Applying Data Science To My YouTube Data: My Surprising Findings,"Interesting analysis! 

Another factor to consider is the content of the videos themselves. Your videos cover various topics like data science as a study / career path, project demos (like this one), and work / life suggestions. So, is there a coloration between the content of the videos (factoring in some of the other influences) and the response metrics? 

And while you are taking into consideration which days you post videos, have you considered simply posting on a particular day routinely? Lastly, are you LOSING subscribers and are there any suggestions, if this is occurring, as why this is happening? 

Keep up the good work!! Looking forward to a follow-up video (if I just haven't gotten to it yet)."

9794,Data Science in Sports - Talk for Northwestern (Kellogg) MBA Students,How much a sports data analyst can earn?
9795,Data Science in Sports - Talk for Northwestern (Kellogg) MBA Students,"Are we talking contested shot slightly contested, open, or just all shots from that rang. Seems like the numbers can change dramatically based off this info."
9796,Data Science in Sports - Talk for Northwestern (Kellogg) MBA Students,"Hey, Ken. Thank you for sharing your journey and experience. It is really helpful for me. I have a couple of questions.

As you used to play Gold and Baseball and you have more knowledge about Basketball. I am a guy who played mostly Cricket from my childhood and some sports which I sometimes play and watch are badminton, hockey, car, and bike racing.

So Which is a better choice for a person like me. Should I try to apply my skills in games like baseball or Basketball or is it better to go ahead with the games which I played till now?

Would you like to share your thought on this topic? Which sports should one choose while entering into sports analytics?"
9797,Data Science in Sports - Talk for Northwestern (Kellogg) MBA Students,"Hey ken, I have been watching your videos for at least 1 hour a day the past week and I love the content. I’m 19 and am beginning my journey towards my career in data science/sports analytics and your content has by far been the best I’ve come across. I was wondering if there was an email that I could contact you with? Or would you prefer Lengthy YouTube comments instead? Either way, thanks again for the free content it’s very appreciated."
9798,Data Science in Sports - Talk for Northwestern (Kellogg) MBA Students,"Hello there, I have a question. I know next to nothing about maths but are you taking in consideration the fact that Shaq has two separate shots or free-throws, while Steph only has one shot?
Let's think about a coin toss example, the probability to land heads twice is equal to 1/2*1/2=1/4, so let's say Shaq has a 50% success rate at shooting freethrows wouldn't it be 0.25*2 his expected buckets?"
9799,Data Science in Sports - Talk for Northwestern (Kellogg) MBA Students,"Fascinating. I could listen to this for hours. Had no idea analytics was involved in recruiting. Would love to hear more about how you might help a team develop strategies on how to beat a specific opponent. I appreciate what you sent me on LinkedIn a month or so ago, but I'm very behind on my reading.

A lot to understand and study, for me, it's still tricky were to specialize the knowledge. I do like ML, but AI will be the future! #66daysofdata"
9810,"Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI: What's the Difference?","Sorry bro, ML is totally different with DS, ML just uses DS to manipulate data but ML and DS are not the same and ML is not a part of DS, ok -_-"
9811,"Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI: What's the Difference?","Sorry but your definition is totally misleading because Artificial Intelligence is not a field of data science neither machine learning but machine learning is a subset of AI and AI is a subset Computer Science. It has been so since 1956 and has never changed. People who develop AI algorithms are computer scientists not data scientists. 

Just like Mathematics is not a subset of Physics, yes Data Scientists use lot of ML to solve problems but they do not generally study AI like computer scientist do. Just like physicists uses math but they do not study math like mathematicians do. You can also say so about medical professionals when comparing them to biologists.

Thanks... Just wanted to highlight"

9819,I Eat a Papaya Live on Stream (Plus Q&A for 150K Subs!),Thanks for the live stream! The dinosaur shirt needs to be a sellable product on your website with your branding! It would sell!
9820,I Eat a Papaya Live on Stream (Plus Q&A for 150K Subs!),"Came for the papaya, stayed for the wisdom and wizardry! 🔥🔥 stream Ken, congrats to you and the community! If you haven’t already definitely read David Goggin’s book (Can’t Hurt Me) and Jesse Itzler’s book where Goggin’s lives with him for 30 days (Living with a Seal), I read them both and went a little H.A.M off the back of it and did an impromptu 65k ultra marathon last year. 

Also, was taking notes all through the stream, and added some of my thoughts:
1. Yes there are a lot of tools out there particularly stuff that will automate and streamline DS and ML workflows. There are however a TONNN of companies which have barely scratched the surface when it comes to DS having an adept captain at the wheel is going to be the difference between them being successful versus not. (18:24)
2. Advice on self studying data science, just get started with something! 100% hands down the best advice, pick something you’re interested in and go for it (32:31)
3. Loved the fact that you both called out developing fundamental skills. Having a strong base allows you to move quickly and stay up to date with innovation in the field (51:50), I’m off to study LDA right now. 

N.b. Had a little freak out when you dropped the c word (c***right strike) 😅"

9831,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,Get rid of it all together I say!
9832,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,"It's obvious to many that the current 3pt line is not far enough from the rim but it's fascinating to see that there's data backing it up and to pinpoint to where the ideal distance is, super fascinating work! It's no wonder that more and more teams such as the Utah Jazz are trying to eliminate the mid-range 2's entirely and replace those with 3's instead, but it's also interesting to see players like CP3 does not shy away from the mid-range 2's in the clutch (and has the full freedom to do so) likely backed by their individual statistics that is way above the league average thus making it a worthwhile shot."
9833,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,"I was really anaware about the points system in basketball 🏀 it's really good analysis...

One thing is sure that players need to be focused on  from where they are throwing a basketball towards the hoop 😀 It makes the game challenging and may increase customer engagement..."
9834,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,"#40: Inspirational project video here!
When I watched the graphs, and then the Steph Curry one, I thought about the sweet spot on finding insights from the best players to transfer that to coaches who train new talents. 
Somehow the data can lead to something. I'm positive about that!
#66daysofdata"
9835,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,"Technically speaking, shouldn’t the 3 point line ideally be around 5-10 feet from the rim due to the rapid organic drop in fg% from 60% to 40% you pointed out at 1:59? And then move the free throw line back to 25 feet, have all shooting fouls yield 2 free throws except and-1s which would still be 1 ft. This makes the ev for 2s, 3s, and non and-1 ft trips equal at roughly 1.2. (Given the average ft% now is about 75% at 15 feet, I’m assuming it would be about 60% at 25 feet)"
9836,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,Most players are starting to shoot deeper threes anyway so I don't think moving the line back a foot and a half will do that much. I could be wrong tho.
9837,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,As a basketball fan and a data science enthusiast I loved this video. I would be very interested to see how something  like that (moving the 3 point line back) would effect the way defensive schemes are designed and how it would change the game as a whole. I have also talked to people in the past about the idea of simply removing those corner threes and having the arc be 23.75 feet all the way to the sidelines. I think cutting out that corner 3 would have a huge effect on both offensive and defensive schemes.
9838,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,"Ken, the 3 point shot means that defenses can no longer help against offensive ball penetration because 3 point shooters have become so expert and are stationed too far away from the basket.  With the increase in dribbling ability along with an increase in athleticism to convert alley-oop dunks so easily, even the 2-0n-2 game has become impossible to stop.  Basketball's offensive/defensive balance has been totally ruined.  Defenses can neither take away the 3 point or 2 point game in today's NBA as the rules are currently set up.  When there was only a 2 point basket, defenses could help on ball penetration and know that a distance shot would not destroy their ability to compete in the game.  Moving the 3 point basket out further only exacerbates this problem by creating more space that a defense has to cover after positioning its resources to defend the 2 point game.  If the defense chooses to shut down the 3 point shooters by staying with them, then the defense is decimated with the 2 point game.


The NBA has a structural problem that data analytics cannot fix."
9839,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,#GoodTalk
9840,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,"Love the analysis, thought it was super interesting! Thought of another question as I am working toward switch fields to data science. What types of things would you want to see on a resume/CV with no formal data science background besides data science projects, and github?"
9841,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,Love this video and this kind of content.  I can imagine that if the line was moved back to 25 feet that there would be a massive trickle down effect.  Great shooters would be even more valuable and spacing would be insane in the nba for teams who can convert from that far out.  Corner threes would be a cheat code at that point too since they cant be moved back any further.  I wonder if the court will ever get bigger to address this.  I for one like how the NBA is played right now but am always fascinated by major changes and how teams adapt.
9842,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,That Steph graph was kinda surprising
9843,How Far Should the NBA 3-Point Line Actually Be?,"Wow, is this a coincidence? I just talked with one of my group members about 4 pointers in Big3 league and other stuff relating to sports data analysis this afternoon. Just as I arrived at home a couple mins ago, I turned on my computer and saw this fresh new video which talks about NBA 3-point line. So I immediately commented before watching."

I haven't read it yet by myself (but I want to do it soon), but in the other yt video I've heard that author's research are quite questionable, like lower cancer rate when you sleep less than 8h (something like this). I think this makes sense, because just like diet, everybody's need of sleep is different and it should be more personalized aswell. Nobody should force himself to sleep more if his body doesn't need it. Your channel is great anyway, keep up with the solid work!"

9917,How Statistics Saved the US SERIOUS $$$$ During WW2 #Shorts,"This case also put in persceptive what it is called ""the survivor bias"", in this case taking surviving plane first as the basis for reinforcement. And as said in that video, looking at downed planes was better to look where to make them better. 

The survivor bias is unfortunately a wrong argument used to defend wrong positions all the times, especially by guru wanting to sell ""miraculous cure"" and taking their only survivor as an example of why their ""therapy"" ""works"".

It's the same when using super succesfull billionaires as a path to success ... while ignoring the many upon many who fail while using the exact same techniques. ( People rarely want to recognize external influences as a factor in their success especially chance !)"

9968,How Much Did Cheating Help the Astros Win? (What the Numbers Say),"I actually watched the baseball games to understand the game... How it works, how points system works and many other things...

I also replicated the code into spyder and need to study the code more and need to understand it

I also watched Astros game and I think they used signs to manipulate the shots... I still understand the whole matter but these things should not happen because it reduces the interest of people..."
9969,How Much Did Cheating Help the Astros Win? (What the Numbers Say),"Ken,


Very cool analysis.  I wonder if you could get the data on strikeouts.  I remember seeing some discussion that the Astros' team strikeout % was significantly lower than the MLB average.  If that is the case, then that would give them an advantage in a number of ways - strikeouts are a key metric for pitchers, especially in high leverage late-game situations.


Really looking forward to part two.  Baseball analytics is a particular favorite of mine!"
9970,How Much Did Cheating Help the Astros Win? (What the Numbers Say),How did I miss this upload? Keep up the good work.
9971,How Much Did Cheating Help the Astros Win? (What the Numbers Say),another good analysis would be a batters Hitting average home vs away. There's theory that some teams were doing the same thing for home games. The batters with a much greater batting average at home vs away can be telling.
9972,How Much Did Cheating Help the Astros Win? (What the Numbers Say),How high level of coding do you use?
9973,How Much Did Cheating Help the Astros Win? (What the Numbers Say),I actually just found out that the by inning / at bat data exists! I will hopefully be adding a part 2 to this video with that analysis!
9974,How Much Did Cheating Help the Astros Win? (What the Numbers Say),"Ken - Any data by individual batter? How do we know if the stolen sign was correct? Since a batter only has a second or so to react to a pitch thrown, what if some batters might do better if they didn't believe they knew the sign and, therefore, might overthink the at bat? So far, you won't be able to answer these questions. However, can you split the sample by runners on base vs no runners on base? (btw, I still need to respond to the info you sent regarding 2 point conversion. Thx for that!)"
9975,How Much Did Cheating Help the Astros Win? (What the Numbers Say),"For those wanting more specifics on the Linear and logistic regressions: For both models the p value of bangs was not significant.

We must grow, remain the same doesn't help to our environment.
#66daysofdata"
9985,Questions You Should Ask Your Data Science Interviewers,"The last question could be understood as if you were fishing for feedback, hence might indicate lack of confidence or even a lack of understanding to the position you are interviewing for. After all, you have supposedly done your homework and established a strong link between your knowledge, set of skills and the open position, the company's vision, goals, etc. In other words, how would you add value to the company if you still do not understand how your skills and expertise align with their expectations? As an interviewer, I'd view that question in a negative light. But there are ways around it and you can still get that sort of feedback indirectly. Apart from that, great video and great tips from you as always. Keep it up."

I am severely deaf and can cope  1 to 1 communication using lip reading and able to speak clearly. I am concern about my communication difficulties in meetings and undergo presentations but however in the UK unfortunately there are shortage of Sign Language Interpreter (SLI). It be good idea to set up meetings early something like 8.00 am or late after 5.00 pm because that when SLI are usually available. I like to know how often do regular Data Scientist need to attend meeting during the day, how long and is it everyday? I understand being a typical software engineer for example that the meeting are normally 1/2 an hour meeting per day."

10029,5 Data Science Resolutions for 2020,"#57: Hey Ken, how that year went for you? Did you wrote understandable code, attended + DS events (This I think was tricky, the things we can't control), updated your README ➡️ Github, participated in Kaggle competitions, and made projects accessible (✅ I think you kill it in this one, 2020 was the year where I knew you and has been a great journey!)
I just making you accountable he he 😅
#66daysofdata"
10030,5 Data Science Resolutions for 2020,"Great resolutions! Some of my comments:
1) Nice thought, but optimise for what makes sense to YOU, not to some arbitrary set of criteria of what qualifies a ""good code"" by engineers. But obviously if you can't efficiently read/reason about your own code - then improvements are due! Functions/Objets aren't ALWAYS the right way forward, and there are also pros and cons to speed of development VS meeting ""classic"" code standards. Machine Learning is NOT the same as traditional programming, and same measures of quality should not be blindly applied to both.
2) Good thought - but just keep in mind that something that can take a whole evening if you go to an event - can be ""consumed"" at 2x speed on youtube in 40 mins. Events are important for networking and benchmarking yourself against other professionals, but don't have high expectations of actually LEARNING from talks - it's rather inefficient.
3) Github is definitely a place to be. Good README are always appreciated. Please share everything you can - you never know who could benefit from it!
4) Kaggle is amazing platform - it could be very hard to get into their way of thinking (it's like a parallel universe at first), but there is also so much to learn there. Just keep in mind that any particular technology that is state of the art today - might be completely obsolete in a few years time. Approaches to the problem and ways of thinking don't change as often.
5) Best resolution possible! When you do your work truly end-to-end you really learn so much more. I would focus on K8S (that you mentioned earlier) - I think it is the future, and spending time learning AWS or Azure specific ML tools might not be the best investment of your time.


My resolutions:
1) Own my work more end-to-end (same as your 5). Have a say both in how data is collected and presented to the DS team, as well as a say in how the final product looks and feels.  NOT being just a ""cog"" in a chain, but truly understand meaning and impact of my work.
2) Get to a level of Master on Kaggle (same as your 4) if possible, or at least do a few public kernels.
3) Attempt to build side projects which other people who aren't data scientists can interact with (like that pix2pix live demo)
4) Get more certifications and accreditations related to IT and ML
5) Finally get into PyTorch properly and become an expert
6) Improve my ability to read/analyse scientific papers. (So I don't have to wait until some YouTuber reviews them to get an idea about what's going on in our field)
7) Get a grip on Probabilistic Programming - I've been struggling with it for quite some time, and I think I'll be able to make it useful soon!


Thank you for an interesting and relatable video!"

10033,5 Data Science Resolutions for 2020,As an analyst my resolution is to scrutinize each element of my reports and dashboards more.  I tend to focus more on the big picture and forget to focus on how each element could be improved.  As someone who is trying to learn data science my resolution is to give myself a project that seems achievable and finish it by the end of the year.  Documenting is one I think almost all of us can work on.
10034,5 Data Science Resolutions for 2020,"I can't imagine explaining data science, I have enough trouble as it is explaining my job as a data analyst.  It has gotten to the point where I explain data as paint, a blank excel or power bi file as a canvas, and my job is to paint a picture that speaks to my audience.  Still think only half of my friends really understand.  Most just say ""oh so you know how to do pivot tables"" and move on."

10037,The Best Way to Predict NBA Minutes Played,Thanks for posting this! A question; do you happen to have a similar video/method for projecting player ownership within a dfs contest?
10038,The Best Way to Predict NBA Minutes Played,Thank you so much
10039,The Best Way to Predict NBA Minutes Played,"Hello everyone! Dan, one of my followers, pointed out that in this analysis I actually included the dependent variable (minutes played) many of the methods that I tested. Obviously, this is not something that you should do. After re-running the analysis with the correct adjustments made, these were my findings.


Just Previous Game Prediction Score:  7.991422567954051
Previous Three Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.937990350926065
Previous Five Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.82599267659377
Previous Ten Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.872496732886791
Previous Three Games Rolling Median Score:  7.233177023501123
Previous Five Games Rolling Median Score:  7.111145383454696
Previous Ten Games Rolling Median Score:  7.079332689005398


It looks like the past 5 game rolling average is actually the best performing of this group. 


Linear Model Performance: RMSE =  6.3429443807711765
Random Forest Performance: RMSE =  6.284779430662026
Combined Model Performance: RMSE = 6.276509665369035

As expected, the ensemble model performs the best. It appears that adding the linear component does provide a small amount of lift to the results.

10049,Golf STATS: Strokes Gained Explained,Thanks for explaining the technique. It is really interesting...
10050,Golf STATS: Strokes Gained Explained,"Hey Ken, Thanks for the video. I'm curious as to how the expected score is calculated? A 150 yrd approach shot at the US Open from the rough and the same shot at an average tour event don't have the same expected score. Does SG score these 2 shots as equals?

Another example could be year over year SG stats at the same tournament held at the same course. How are course conditions and weather factored into a players SG score. 

Essentially what I am after is this, are strokes gained calculated in isolation within the same round, tournament, PGA tour Season, or every PGA golf shot ever taken?"
10051,Golf STATS: Strokes Gained Explained,"#25: I had to google every single concept about golf🏌🏻, not a fan here, but the metric about strokes gained gave me some insight, some questions: 
- How I can find metrics for some sports that not have a deep study, just checking variables and play with them?
- Do you recommend a way to approach (course, book) how to find those metrics?
You hit the point on this one, spark curiosity for me!!

Total waste of time."
10107,,Nice
10108,,"I don't know what magic WSL2 uses, but it can consume up to 5.5 gigs of RAM of my 7 avaliable (1 gig is allocated to intergated GPU as VRAM). Can you even imagine launching virtual machine which can consume 80% with 1.5 gigs remained for host system?"
10109,,"gui for wsl

10110,,"Wsl consumes so much ram, just open a  very small react app with vs-code running with wsl-remote-extension and it  
uses 1.7 GB of ram. I have 8Gigs on my laptops and with running wsl it literally uses 85% of ram, and also got the BSOD multiple times. So Disappointed !"
10111,,Would love to know the specs of a machine that can handle these!
10112,,"Hey Ken? Just a heads up, I will be using your LinkedIn profile in a motivational YouTube video w/ basketball theme to motivate LinkedIn professionals optimize their LinkedIn profile. :)"
10113,,D-did Ken cheat on Papayas with Persimmon ? I guess there's room for both of them now with WSL 2 :3

10117,,"1:38 I feel attacked, Ken!!! 😡🤬We need Power BI on Linux (and Mac)!! 
Moving past this, I will say that I love me some WSL2!!  I think it's great for learning and practicing Linux commands in the terminal, which IMO is a core skill to have for data science."
10118,,This was my first time knowing about this but it really sounds interesting and something worth look into💯✨
10119,,NEVER liked or could use VM
10120,,I heard about WSL 1 but with this video Everything is clear about WSL2
10121,,"Hi Ken, was wondering if you can do a video on how you have used Linux for data science and what are the advantages of using it over windows? Thanks and great content as always!"
10122,,"Great explanation! I absolutely hated using a VM (crappy performance) so I went with a dual boot setup. I will definitely have to give this a try, thanks!"

It is definitely a great way to pick new techniques, know about new libraries and built great understanding of different methods."
10130,,"I was doing it all wrong till now. When in earlier video you said go through the notebooks, I was literally reading the code not understanding. Thanks for clearly explaining what we are looking for when we look at the code and how to use the documentations the better way. Thank you so much ."
10131,,"Interestingly, i left beginners project many times just because I could not approach and do them myself. And seeing other's notebook looks like cheating to me. Thank you for removing my notion."
10132,,Thanks for explaining the process. Reviewing is the best way which we can apply for learning and I also use discussion like if you have someone with you while studying it leads to good results. I am interacting with you through video but it is really great because it motivates me to come back again and go ahead.
10133,,"I've always had this question on how to approach a solved notebook? Should I code open the notebooks side by side and type in one by one or should I go over the solved one and then try to understand. I always wondered how others might be doing or which is the best approach (if any)! So, how would have approached if that was a video lecture where the solution walkthrough is done? Any suggestions, Ken? And, thanks a ton for creating such nuggets of videos, really helpful for beginners like me. Even the comments sections in your videos are insightful."
10134,,one of the best data science channels out there.. kia kaha tonu..keep going
10135,,"Reviewing the processing code that others have written has exposed a significant issue. Whether the original dataset is already in a ""sanitized"" state or in need of cleaning, reorganization, or transformation a lot of the existing ""notebooks"" show there is little to no evidence of getting to know and understand the data before these examples jump to the exploratory data analysis stage. This boils down to blindly accepting the dataset without question. Is the data accurate? What is the source of the underlying data?


Perhaps an over reliance on so-called curated or well-known datasets is the underlying cause of this phenomenon. Some people, including instructors, claim the exploratory data analysis stage is when you learn about the dataset. In my opinion and based on experience, the exploratory data analysis stage is supposed to be time evaluate whether the data is suitable for the particular question(s) that instigated the project. Prior to EDA is the time to understand the raw data itself but not whether it can potentially answer those questions. The rush to model building exposes another serious deficiency in the way data science of taught - is the goal of the project to explain historical data or predict future outcomes when presented with new data - is the data skewed or is it relatively normally distributed or should the data be normalized or weighted - is  a model necessary? 


The curated datasets have a place in learning data science. However, too often they instill lemming-like cookie-cutter behaviour. Use these datasets to learn a concept but avoid making them part of a portfolio or treating them as a best practise for real projects. If you want to use them to document your data science learning journey that is fine but at least be creative in the way such datasets are presented - consider demonstrating how a seemingly obvious but incorrect/inappropriate machine learning technique can lead to useless, if not erroneous, conclusions and/or models, and state the reason(s) this technique is inappropriate; consider something other than Python and R to process the data, maybe SQL is adequate; consider integrating other data sources so what-if scenarios can be performed, ideally interactively by end-users. For example, what if data about iceberg flows and the route of the HMS Titanic were added to the model, could the collision have been avoided while still reaching New York City in record time? This might require simulated data based on historical data or modelled using knowledge of ocean currents, fluid dynamics, iceberg and ice fields formation and physical characteristics, weather conditions, etc.

Think critically about the data and what if anything it can teach us. Ask the difficult questions and attempt to answer them."
10136,,"Hi Ken
Great content as usual
May I have some recommendations or suggestions from you?
I'm in my graduate study on modeling fish population dynamics. The situation is that I know about one field, working with data and models in this particular area but I wanna make myself a bit more employable post graduation. Therefore, I start looking up about data science, and realize there are some part of data science work I already do (I just don't know it's called data science out there lol). However, there are some part I haven't touched yet (e.g. computer vision, random forest, and neural network). 
Should I do machine learning and deep learning courses to organize my knowledge? 
I deeply understand that nobody can cover all the topics. It's just not happening. What I expect is to be well-prepared for job. 
Thank you"
10137,,"So I did a project on linear regression and I'm still kind of struggling to understand it. I looked up Kaggle Notebooks titled ""Linear Regression"" or something close to that. Other than watch other courses, read other books, and do more projects is there anything else I can do?"
10138,,Let's help ken reach 💯 k  🔥
10139,,This is so helpful. Thank you Ken :D
10140,,"This is actually so much like machine learning algorithms themselves. Like we go through loads of notebooks to understand the innate algorithms and patterns of being s good data scientist and then after we're done training ourselves with others notebooks, we can test our understanding by predicting on newer projects and then matching with others who have done the similar projects. 🙄"

10144,,Until now I used to take on Github notebooks but I think Kaggle is a great option too. Plus there are a lot of introductory notebooks on kaggle if you need to dive in a new concept.
10145,,i feel im gonna quit this field the barrier to entry is too high and i cant build my project out of novel ideas
10146,,"So, I have couple of questions related to transformation techniques (log, boxcox etc). 
- Do I need to use same transformation technique on all the features even though that technique may not be good for other feature?
- Do I need to use transformation on dependent variable too? 
Thanks in advance! again I would like to add that you are doing amazing work!"
10147,,May God bless you for sharing this pertinent information. Thank you professor.
10148,,Which tool is he using for the notes again!?
10149,,Thank you Ken. I'll adopt this approach the more.
10150,,Genius
10151,,Can I have your contact details?? I have some doubts regarding masters in datascience
10152,,"Great work ...It helps to learn Data science in efficient way ,thanks for this work,
by the way  can you say the documentation software  which you are using  it really looks cool"
10153,,can I know which is the note taking app which you are using?
10154,,Thanks Ken. Got a clear idea of how to go about learning data science. Following along with you on the #66daysofdata challenge.
10155,,"Hi Ken, great work, I am also taking part in the amazing #66DaysOfData, great initiative, it's motivating me so much you have no idea! I can't thank you enough for this. What's the name of the app you're using in the video to take notes? Thanks again"
10156,,"This video was great!

I have found some frustration from ""not understanding a topic"" but not looking for a different explanation. For example, I struggled to understand what a p-value is and how it is useful; to understand what the p-value was, I found a statistics textbook and read about it. I still didn't understand and felt doomed to never understand p-values. Using your approach of looking for more resources, I was able to get a better understanding of it! It is a great idea to see a topic explained in different ways and by different sources. Thank you for bringing this technique up!

Thanks for the video Ken!"
10157,,This is dope bro! Seeing you through the process is priceless. Good job. ty
10158,,Happy Teacher's Day!!!
10159,,This is a great approach for people who don't have a lot of free time on their hands. Another amazing video Ken!
10160,,"Yeah, I totally agree with this approach. Whenever I start to work on something, I try to learn the steps form another person's GitHub. If I end with new function or new term I basically Google it out or search in stack. And I found that if I do the same patterns of problems or project for 4/5 times then I will have picked the patterns  already.
It's amazing, Ken.
Thanks for sharing 😊"
10161,,You are a life saver !!
10162,,"Ken, Thanks for the great insight. Very useful video for beginners."
10163,,"Happy Teacher's Day ken, Thanks for sharing...🧡"
10164,,This was super helpful ! :)
10165,,"Just curious, but why do you have 3 clocks in your room😅"
10166,,Thanks for valuable tips Ken. I am going to apply them on my #66DaysOfData  journey and projects from now on
10167,,"Today is teacher's day in India, so Happy teacher's day Ken. So far your guidance through these videos is really helping me learn Data science. Thank you."
10168,,"As a 20% data scientist 😅 I totally agree with this approach. I also remember you saying anyone who is learning a new thing should seek 30% theoretical knowledge and 70% practice, I also agree with that. 

Keep up! You are crushing it! 💪"
10169,,Amazing video Ken! This is so insightful and helpful for my data science journey
10170,,Always loves your video. You are inspiration I work so hard learning this field. Could you please help me in some of the topics I asked you on #66DaysOfData? I am stucked and I really need some help.
10171,,Thanks amen! I appreciate you helping others learn faster and more efficiently. I haven’t seen all the resources but it’ll be great you posting more resources to find codes other have built! Looking forward to more!
10172,,Thanks ken for being you :)
10173,,"Bro, I am a developer who is thinking to learn but while thinking got stuck much places. Without knowing basis how need to move like that I thought. Basics is completely theoretical. Your way is awesome to learn tq so much❤. I can use this in different field also. I am doing the 66 day challenge  even got confusing. You cleared my way which need to proceed. Do well like these videos much. Thank you so much."
10174,,Thank u sir for this video You clear all my doubts.🙂🙂🙂
10175,,"KenJee, 
could talk about github repos that are great exemples of very well coded end-to-end data science projects?"
10176,,"Exactly what I was looking for 
Thank you man"
10177,,"On one hand I really love your channel and I don´t want it to become mainstream but on the other hand I really hope you will be rewarded for the effort & quality that comes with these videos. - So here you get a comment for the algorithm :D
Starting my Data Science Bachelor soon & your videos are like steroids for my motiviation :) Keep it up man!"
10178,,Thanks KEN keep up the good work!
10179,,👏 Practical 👏 Tips 👏 FOR THE WIN
10180,,"I am just a beginner and not an expert, but I think beginners should take the first notebook(by Pedro Marcelino) with a pinch of salt. There are some things I found very wrong in this notebook:

1. You don't always need to drop multicollinear variables. 1 most widely used model in Kaggle is XGBoost and it is immune to multicollinearity. I think, so are other random forest like models.
2. Dropping a variable because it has more than 15% missing data is a bad idea. This threshold is too much in my humble opinion.

There are more things which much more experience Data Scientists have pointed out in comments section.

I am not saying it's entirely useless but it is not great to follow it 100%. It has maximum votes but maybe it's just an outliar in Kaggle's dataset of Notebooks."
10181,,Great video Ken! Your daily progress updates on discord motivates me even more. Thank you for doing this😊
10182,,"I really love this initiative! It really motivates me everyday to know that thousands of others are also learning the field!
I think reviewing notebooks is a great idea and I'll definitely do that as well in future days-of-data, for now I'll focus on the theory first.
Let's build some habits!"
10183,,"Thank you, you answered the exact question I had, how to best go about this."
10184,,"Thanks for watching everyone! Keep up the great work with the #66DaysOfData Challenge! More info on that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXLnbdHMf8w&ab_channel=KenJee

10185,,Excellent tips 👍
10186,,This will be what I do
10187,,Wow. Best video I’ve seen for learning date science / analysis
10188,,"This is a highly valuable and useful video!
Thanks a ton Ken!🙌"
10189,,"Great video Ken! Learning from other people's code is a great way to learn. Another great way to learn for me is code reviewing where for example some of my colleague or students would send over their code as a Jupyter notebook where I would go over the code, figure out how the ML model workflow could be improved, could be faster, could add some areas of novelty, etc. such that the resulting research paper would have a chance for publication in a scientific journal. Afterwards, I would have discussion with the person who wrote the code and together we can learn from one another on the rationale for choosing a specific approach and whether some component could be adjusted to provide better performance, new areas of novelty, etc. 
On another note, Amazing video editing (pattern interrupts 😃), also noticed that you're using Notion as placeholders for the code, great tips! (Wow, I've just noticed how long this comment has become)"
10190,,ofcos he didnt look good
10191,,I love hands-on learning
10192,,I thought that I hate this field but you help me to realize how much I still love this field and I quit my meaningless and bad job to be better and learn more because that job didn't make me a better data scientist. You even inspire me to write articles. thank you so much.
10193,,"thanks man! This is helping me unblock things in my head, and allows me to keep my own personal #66daysofdata alive :) Plus, I already wanted to check the very notebook you're showing there (since I am doing a lot of this uncooperative House regression thingy). It also an important lesson since, so far, I wanted to take pride into trying to build my own model alone from scratch without external help ... well, I guess I came as far as I could with this method which your video is helping me understand :)"
10194,,I think this is actually an incredible idea
10195,,"You are such an inspiration to us!!

Thanks for motivating us :)"
10196,,"Bro. This is top. Maybe you have already said it and I'm mistaken, but I haven't been able to find it in your videos. What kind of projects would you recommend for getting a data ANALYST job (I've seen the data scientist recommendations, but I suppose they are not the same). I would really appreciate it, although I know you are busy. Thank you for everything ;-)"
10197,,"Love your content! 
Willing to start the #66DaysofData 
Kudos!!!!!!!!"
10198,,I do not think the 3 point should be move and I think dunks and anything really close should be lowered to 1 point
10199,,"I believe there should be a 4 point and 5 point shot, the 5 point would be half court and the 4 would be halfway between the 3 and 5"
10200,,26ft? You realize if this was the 4point line Steph Curry and Dame Lillard are going to murder the league. Steph is shooting 43.7 percent from 25-29 ft. He is shooting 45.3 percent from 30-35 ft. Dame is shooting 40% from 25-29 ft and 34% from 30-35 ft. Analytically shooting 25% from 4 is equivalant to shooting 50% from 2 point range. If Steph Curry was to shoot 43.7 percent from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 87% from 2 point range. If Dame Lillard is shooting 40% from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 80% from 2 point range. In context Shaq who was one of the most dominant players ever shot a field goal percentage of 58.2%. So unless you can get wide open dunks on almost every trip down the court dealing with a potential 40% 4 point shooter is not something this league is ready for.
10201,,"#43: When I see this kind of video (Like the 2 or 3 points or shot) could be nice having more animation background because it's really interesting, the average person (who understands Basketball and no knowledge of DS) could be awed by a little more ... I think.
Anyways, it's a great video. 🙌🏻
#66daysofdata"
10202,,"Technically speaking, shouldn’t the 3 point line ideally be around 5-10 feet from the rim due to the rapid organic drop in fg% from 60% to 40% you pointed out at 3:55? And then move the free throw line back to 25 feet, have all shooting fouls yield 2 free throws except and-1s which would still be 1 ft. This makes the ev for 2s, 3s, and non and-1 ft trips equal at roughly 1.2. (Given the average ft% now is about 75% at 15 feet, I’m assuming it would be about 60% at 25 feet)"
10203,,Have you ever played around with any Fantasy basketball or fantasy football analysis/prediction?
10204,,"What about adding a 2.5-point line a little bit closer to the basket than the current 3-point line (2 feet closer?), that would give a boost to the no-man's land and the now reluctantly taken and often frowned-upon mid-range jumper. And then moving the 3-point line a bit further away. I think this could eventually make the game more interesting. It only takes a bid getting used to 0.5 points; and if you are fouled while attempting a 2.5 point shot, the first time team gets 2 free-throws, next time this happens 3 free throws are rewarded. It might be worth a try. Haven't read that elsewhere as of yet."
10205,,"nice to see some truly novel analysis outside of the millions of ""predicting handwritten digits from mnist"" videos"
10206,,"I thought for sure I could be the annoying guy that said you forgot about how the 4 pt shot helps the value of a 3 pt shot.  I was wrong!  great video as usual.  Love the way you break this stuff down and cover the shortfalls at the end.  I think there are quite  a few things the NBA should look into before this, most importantly scheduling."
10207,,"Hi guys, silly question... I have a masters degree in Eng, and I have been studying Data Science for a couple of months, and I have a working knowledge of Python... I wanted to move towards a DS career, but I am not sure how long should I study for before I can start to apply for DS jobs, any oppinions?"
10208,,Super useful video..!
10209,,"Sends out Cold Email
     >Gets Blacklisted For Life"
10210,,"I didn’t know hiring managers were different from recruiters either. 😮 Also, I’m glad that this video validates my recent focus on learning how to deploy models. I check nearly all the boxes for the basic data scientist you described, so I appreciate the advice on how to differentiate one’s self. 🙏🏻"
10211,,Hi there! I recalled you mentioning that you could become a data scientist in 6 months if you put your head to it. Does this include a certified degree which will allow you to be applicable for a job which a 3/4 year degree student would be applicable for?
10212,,"Interesting analysis. 
Job boards are least helpful. Find the employer's email from a job board and send an email. LinkedIn is helpful but one really needs to know how it exactly works. Just applying through LinkedIn doesn't help, so constant engagement might help."
10213,,"Sir,please provide your advise on this:
 i'm a student aspiring to become a data scientist.But i only know python as much as till looping and conditional statements.I also know the basics of pandas like reading dataframes and assigning that to a variable.But another youtuber said that if we need to become a data scientist,we must start working on data science projects ASAP and that we must learn whatever skills we require for that project along the way.But i saw a kaggler's end to end project solution and nearly recieved a stroke as everything looked like Greek and Latin.Pls help as i dont know where to begin for solving data science projects.
(i)Please suggest the appraoch that i shd take towards solving data science projects as i still dont know a lot of the programming required though im eager to learn
(ii)Also,how can i increase my knowledge quickly in tensorflow,seaborn etc that are required to begin doing projects"
10214,,"Hey Ken,

What are the coding workshops (applications/softwares) you would recommend for someone with no technological background whatsoever who wants to pursue sports analytics."
10215,,133k subs lets go
10216,,I swear if someone with only a google cert gets a job before me
10217,,"Focus on income, not outcome. Got it. Thanks!"
10218,,"I had probably missed this channel for months. Hooked to learning some other staffs outside Data Analytics. But...It's nice to be back, haha."
10219,,hi sir. Is it possible to get a freelance data science job even tough I only have a bootcamp and no experience at all. I'm planning to shift to data science career but as of now I can't risk to resign on my current job so I'm planning to have a frealance/work from home job before becoming fulltime on DS. Any suggestions on how to get a freelance job or On the Job Training? THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP!
10220,,"Always interesting to see numbers and get a better understanding of the magnitude of differences. In hindsight, it makes sense but the cold emailing thing was a surprise to me. Thanks for sharing this, Ken."
10221,,"I am working as a mobile developer and i am really thinking about shifting to data science field, may you advice me if it's good choice to make + is it going to affect the salary !?"
10222,,"Hey Ken :) Thank you for all the amazing content. I've been binging this past week, since finding your channel.

I have some constructive criticism. I've noticed that the mixing is frequently ""off"" when you're interviewing someone. Your volume is typically leveled higher than the guest's, which makes it difficult to consume, without having the volume dial at the ready, to live mix.

Regardless, I appreciate you and the work you've done for this community!"
10223,,"I enjoy LinkedIn. I now need to keep ""Cold Emailer"" in my job search skill set. ❄📧

I did initially try the ""Spray and Pray"" method (failed w/ lots of applications). So, the other two is definitely the ""Go-To."""
10224,,"I finished interview for a computer vision engineer.  It's been 7 days and I'm just waiting for an email or call telling me if I got it or not.

Previously  I spoke to a recruiter at Facebook and AWS They never got back to me. It can be discouraging to apply and just get ghosted."
10225,,"Do you think that MS graduates from “top schools” (and who’ve done well academically and with projects, etc) have a better shot at getting interviews through their schools and through their alumni networks?"
10226,,Thanks Ken!
10227,,I've been hunting for ds internships for several months now and this is relly helpful!
10228,,Super useful information for people applying right now! Maybe that’s why I had to apply to over a thousand jobs to actually get an offer lol
10229,,Interesting data :)
10230,,I love to use cold emails/messages to network.  When i first started doing this it was so weird.  What I found was offering some type of value to the person was best to gain traction and also have a better feeling myself knowing that I wasn't just using this new person as a resource only.  New relationships can be mutually benefiical for both parties and it shouldn't just be one-way!  Great content as always Ken!
10231,,Really helpful 🙌
10232,,This is really very eye opening! 👀 Thanks for doing this video!
10233,,"what's your beef with @alextheanalyst
when will it stop
or is this a PR stunt??"
10234,,"If I understood the article correctly this is only for US and Canada. As a European I think the data may differ drastically due to the job market culture. In my opinion here Universities are the most popular and even maybe the only way to get into the field if you want companies to look at you seriously. It's just my opinion, bit I am pointing this out for your international viewers just in case."
10235,,"I've been watching you since last year, and the production quality has improved drastically! I'm happy to see this channel grow :D"
10236,,"I think if you want to go the cold-call email route, a nice python automation script might cut down a lot of time.  You should be able to scrape a lot of companies' email addresses and then send out emails to them with your CV. This can be repeated or done once-off? Or would it be better to cater each email to the comany that you send it to?"
10237,,From opinion likedin would be better option because normal job application goes through resume software which get rejected mostly so  networking with people on LinkedIn engaging and making connections and talking to potential recruiter will be best choice but bad side of cold email  is  getting those mail people sometimes spam those which is totally not cool ....these are my opinion of course other people can have there own as well🙌💯
10238,,So insightful 🙏
10239,,"Wow... Right video at right time 😃
This will help me while apply for data science jobs🤞

Great article Jeremie Harris🙌 Thanks..."
10240,,"Well this is eye opening. 

I guess I need to take a deep breath,  put on my big boy pants, push anxiety aside and start cold e-mailing"
10241,,Your videos are always insightful and helpful :)
10242,,"Dear sir, can u please tell the syllabus learn data science and free resources?"
10243,,If any job
10244,,"Thanks for watching everyone! To be clear, this video is not sponsored in any way by SharpestMinds. They were generous enough to give me the slide deck to share with you though!
